            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Thus had <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in writing his Treatiſe of Animals the aſsiſtance of <hi>Alexander;</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage of <hi>Titus Veſpatian</hi> to his Natural Hiſtory.</p>

            <p>THough this <hi>Eſſay</hi> has ſwell'd to ſo much greater a <hi>Bulk</hi> than ever I expected it could poſſibly have done, that I might well have ſuperſeded any further addreſs than that of <hi>Dedication;</hi> yet it being but neceſſary to acquaint the <hi>Reader</hi> with ſome matters, that are general, and will ſerve for all other <hi>Counties</hi> as well as <hi>this,</hi> I thought good to put them down briefly as followeth.</p>
            <p>And first, that though I dare not pretend the <hi>Map</hi> of <hi>Oxford-ſhire</hi> prefixt to this <hi>Eſſay,</hi> is ſo accurate as any I ſhall make hereafter, yet I dare promiſe the <hi>Reader</hi> it far exceeds any we had before; for beſide that it contains all the <hi>Mercat Towns,</hi> and many <hi>Pariſhes</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by <hi>Saxton, Speed, &amp;c.</hi> it ſhews alſo the <hi>Villages,</hi> diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a different <hi>mark</hi> and <hi>character,</hi> and the Houſes of the <hi>Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> and others of any magnitude within the <hi>County;</hi> and all theſe with their <hi>bearings</hi> to one another, according to the <hi>Compaſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for the <hi>diſtances,</hi> though I dare not promiſe them <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically</hi> exact (which by reaſon of the <hi>riſings</hi> and <hi>fallings</hi> of the ground, <hi>interpoſitions</hi> of <hi>Woods, Rivers, &amp;c.</hi> I think ſcarce poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in many places to be given at all) yet ſome few of them are as <hi>true,</hi> as actual <hi>dimenſuration,</hi> and moſt of them as the doctrin of <hi>Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles,</hi> and the beſt information, all compared together, could direct me to put them: So that provided they have not been moved in the <hi>Graving</hi> (as I think they have but little) I take them all ſeated not far from the <hi>truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the <hi>ſcale</hi> of <hi>miles,</hi> there being three ſorts in <hi>Oxford-ſhire,</hi> the greater, leſſer, and middle <hi>miles,</hi> as almost every where elſe; it is contrived according to the middle ſort of them; for theſe I conceive may be moſt properly called the true <hi>Oxford-ſhire</hi> miles, which upon actual <hi>dimenſuration</hi> at ſeveral places, I found to contain for the moſt part <hi>9 furlongs</hi> and a <hi>quarter,</hi> of which about <hi>60</hi> anſwer a <hi>Degree:</hi> Where by the way its but expedient that the <hi>Reader</hi> take notice, that I intend not that there are <hi>60</hi> of theſe <hi>miles</hi> in a degree, according to the common account; for reckoning <hi>5280</hi> feet, (or eight
<pb facs="tcp:172327:6"/>
               <hi>furlongs</hi>) to a <hi>mile,</hi> as is uſual in <hi>England,</hi> no leſs than <hi>69</hi> will cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond to a <hi>degree;</hi> upon which account it is and no other, that of the middle <hi>Oxford-ſhire</hi> miles, each containing <hi>9 furlongs</hi> and a <hi>quarter,</hi> about 60 will do it.</p>
            <p>According to theſe <hi>miles,</hi> the <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>North latitude</hi> are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into <hi>minutes</hi> on each ſide the <hi>Map,</hi> chiefly made off from the exact <hi>Northern</hi> latitude of <hi>Oxford,</hi> collected from the many years obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of <hi>Dr. Banbridg,</hi> and at laſt concluded to be ſeated in the <hi>46 minute</hi> of the <hi>51 degree, proxime;</hi> the <hi>52<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> degree</hi> beginning at the ſmall line paſſing through <hi>Mixbury, Clifton,</hi> north of <hi>Dedding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> the two <hi>Barfords, South Nuneton,</hi> and between <hi>Hoke Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and the <hi>Lodge:</hi> By which diviſion 'tis eaſie to know to a <hi>minute</hi> of a degree, nay almoſt to a <hi>ſecond,</hi> in what latitude every <hi>Town, Pariſh, Village,</hi> and <hi>Gentlemans</hi> Houſe is ſeated.</p>
            <p>Beſide, for the <hi>Houſes</hi> of the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> this <hi>Map</hi> is ſo contrived, that a <hi>Foreigner</hi> as well as <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> at what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſoever, may with eaſe find out who are the <hi>Owners</hi> of moſt of them; ſo as to be able to ſay that this is ſuch or ſuch a <hi>Gentlemans</hi> Houſe: And all this done by <hi>Figures</hi> put to every ſuch <hi>Houſe,</hi> which referring again to <hi>Figures</hi> of the ſame value, placed in order over the <hi>Arms</hi> in the <hi>Limb</hi> of the <hi>Map,</hi> ſhew in the bottom of each <hi>Shield</hi> the <hi>Nobleman</hi> or <hi>Gentlemans name,</hi> whoſe houſe it is; their reſpective <hi>Coats</hi> of <hi>Arms</hi> being always placed between the <hi>Figure</hi> and <hi>Name:</hi> which too (all but ſome few) are cut in their <hi>metals, furs,</hi> or <hi>colours,</hi> as born by their <hi>Owners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And not only the <hi>Shields,</hi> but <hi>Ordnaries, Charges, Differences, &amp;c.</hi> where they are not too ſmall: if <hi>Argent,</hi> being left <hi>white;</hi> if <hi>Or,</hi> filled with ſmall points; if <hi>Gules,</hi> lineated <hi>perpendicular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> or in <hi>pale;</hi> if <hi>Azure, horizontally,</hi> or <hi>feſs-ways;</hi> if <hi>Vert, obliquely</hi> or <hi>bend-ways;</hi> if <hi>Sable,</hi> both <hi>pale</hi> and <hi>feſs-ways,</hi> as may be ſeen in the <hi>Map,</hi> which are all the <hi>colours</hi> made uſe of there. And if ever hereafter I ſhall meet with any bearing <hi>Purpure, Ten,</hi> or <hi>Sanguine;</hi> the firſt ſhall be repreſented with <hi>Lines</hi> in <hi>bend ſiniſter; Ten,</hi> with <hi>lines ſalter-ways,</hi> mixt of <hi>Vert</hi> and <hi>Purpure;</hi> and <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine, paly bendy,</hi> mixt of <hi>Gules</hi> and <hi>Purpure.</hi>

And ſecondly, <hi>Vagabonds</hi> deterr'd from making counterfeit <hi>Paſſes,</hi> by puting falſe <hi>names</hi> and <hi>Seals</hi> to them, both which may be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuch <hi>Maps</hi> as theſe.</p>
            <p>To theſe add the ancient houſes of <hi>Kings,</hi> the principal <hi>Seats</hi> of ancient <hi>Baronies,</hi> ancient <hi>Ways, Fortifications,</hi> and the ſites of <hi>Religious houſes,</hi> all diſtinguiſh'd as deſcribed by their reſpective <hi>marks</hi> in the <hi>Table</hi> for that purpoſe.

            <p>Yet this <hi>Map,</hi> though it contains near five times as much as any other of the <hi>County</hi> before, partly by reaſon of its being the <hi>firſt</hi> I ever made, and partly becauſe, either of the pure <hi>ignorance</hi> or <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> of ſome, and over <hi>curious pieviſhneſs</hi> that I met with amongſt others, is not ſo perfect, I confeſs, as I wiſh it were; there being upon theſe accounts, ſome few <hi>Arms</hi> omitted, and others out of place at the foot of the <hi>Map,</hi> and perhaps here and there a <hi>Village</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd: wherefore I have entertained ſome thoughts of cutting it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and perhaps ſomwhat larger, to be hung up in <hi>Frames</hi> (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out alteration of this for the <hi>Book</hi>) with all the <hi>defects</hi> above-mentioned ſupplyed; provided ſuch <hi>Gentry</hi> as find their <hi>Arms</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, or any <hi>Villages</hi> near them containing ten houſes (under which number I ſeldom think them worth notice) pleaſe to bring in their <hi>Arms</hi> in <hi>colours,</hi> with the particular <hi>bearings</hi> and <hi>diſtances</hi> of their <hi>Houſes</hi> and <hi>Villages,</hi> from the moſt noted place near them, to the <hi>Porter</hi> or one of the <hi>Keepers</hi> of the <hi>Bodleyan Library,</hi> who will be ready to receive them, or any other Curioſity of <hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> in order to the compiling an <hi>Appendix</hi> to this <hi>Work,</hi> to be Printed apart.</p>
            <p>Which is all concerning the <hi>Map,</hi> but that the <hi>Reader</hi> alſo note,
<pb facs="tcp:172327:7"/>
that the Right Honorable the Earl <hi>of Berkſhire,</hi> Lord <hi>Lovelace, &amp;c.</hi> are deſignedly left out, in regard that though they have <hi>Eſtates</hi> and <hi>Seats</hi> in this <hi>County,</hi> yet their chiefeſt, and places of moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reſidence being elſewhere, I have choſen rather to omit them here, and to place them in <hi>thoſe</hi> that ſeem their more deſirable <hi>Counties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> it ſelf, I can adviſe little more, but that I undertook it at first for my own <hi>pleaſure,</hi> the ſubject of it being ſo pleaſant, and of ſo great variety, that it ſurpriſed me to think how many Learned <hi>Ages</hi> had paſt (careful and laborious enough in compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Geographical</hi> Hiſtories of <hi>England</hi>) without ſo much as ever attemting that of <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Arts:</hi> it ſeeming to be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign (had the <hi>Undertaker</hi> been ſuitable) more highly deſerving of the publick too, than either of the former, as tending not only to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of a ſort of <hi>Learning</hi> ſo much neglected in <hi>England,</hi> but of <hi>Trade</hi> alſo, which I hope in ſome meaſure is made to appear in the following <hi>Treatiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which though ſufficient to juſtifie my choice of this <hi>ſubject,</hi> yet I ventured not upon it without the joint approbation of the moſt knowing in theſe matters, ſuch as the Honorable <hi>Robert Boyle</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
               <hi>Dr. Willis, Dr. Wallis, Dr. Bathurſt, &amp;c.</hi> whoſe celebrated names ſerving to remove the groundleſs ſuſpitions many had of the attemt, I proceeded to give this <hi>Specimen</hi> of it: Wherein the <hi>Reader</hi> is only deſired to take notice, that moſt of the <hi>Curioſities,</hi> whether of <hi>Art, Nature,</hi> or <hi>Antiquities</hi> engraven in the <hi>Cuts,</hi> are ſo certain truths, that as many as were portable, or could be procured, are in the hands of the <hi>Author.</hi> But for ſuch things as are inſeparable from their places, they remain to be ſeen as in the History directed, there being nothing here mention'd, but what either the <hi>Author</hi> has ſeen himſelf, or has recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unqueſtionable <hi>teſtimony</hi> for it, which for the moſt part, if not alwaies, the <hi>Reader</hi> will find cited.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Philoſophical</hi> part, I have chiefly embraced the <hi>Principles</hi> of Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> as the moſt univerſally known and received, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt likely (in this <hi>inquiſitive Age</hi>) to be the trueſt; which if I have any where miſ-applied (as 'tis manifold odds ſome where or other I may) yet I doubt not but the Learned and ſober <hi>Reader</hi> will can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly accept of the <hi>honeſty</hi> of my <hi>endeavor</hi> in excuſe of my <hi>Error.</hi> But as for the hot-headed half-witted <hi>Cenſurer,</hi> who perhaps only looks on the Title of a <hi>Chapter,</hi> or here and there a <hi>Paragraph</hi> that makes for
<pb facs="tcp:172327:7"/>
his turn, I must and do expect the laſh of his tongue, it being indeed his buſineſs to find out the <hi>lapſes,</hi> and decry all <hi>attemts,</hi> wherein <hi>(for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth)</hi> he himſelf has not been conſulted: But I would have ſuch to know (that if I meet with but proportionable encouragement from the former) 'tis not all they can ſay or do, ſhall diſcourage me from my <hi>purpoſe;</hi> for if I have erred in any thing, I ſhall gladly receive the calm reproofs of my <hi>Friends,</hi> and ſtill go on till I do underſtand my buſineſs aright, in the mean time contemning the <hi>verdict</hi> of the <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi> and <hi>faſtidious</hi> that throw words in hast.</p>

                  <hi>OXFORD,</hi> being not undeſervedly by Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> ſtiled, <hi>Our most noble Athens, The Muſes ſeat,</hi> and, <hi>One of</hi> Englands <hi>Pillars;</hi> nay, <hi>The Sun, The Eye,</hi> &amp;c. It would have occaſion'd as ſtrange a remark, as any to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in this whole Eſſay, had there not ſome eminent Celeſtial Obſervations been made in this County; eſpecially ſince that ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendous Mathematical Inſtrument, now called the <hi>Teleſcope,</hi> ſeems to have been known here above 300 years ago. But theſe being chiefly matters of Art, relating either to the diſcovery of the magnitude, figure, or determination of the motions of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bodies, muſt be referr'd (as moſt proper) to the end of this Work; it being my purpoſe in this <hi>Hiſtory of Nature,</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the moſt natural method that may be.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And therefore I ſhall conſider, firſt, Natural Things, ſuch as either ſhe hath retained the ſame from the beginning, or freely produces in her ordinary courſe; as <hi>Animals, Plants,</hi> and the <hi>univerſal furniture of the World.</hi> Secondly, her <hi>extravagancies</hi> and <hi>defects,</hi> occaſioned either by the exuberancy of matter, or obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy of impediments, as in <hi>Monſters.</hi> And then laſtly, as ſhe is reſtrained, forced, faſhioned, or determined, by Artificial Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. All which, without abſurdity, may fall under the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral notation of <hi>a Natural Hiſtory,</hi> things of Art (as the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="bottom">De Augm Scient. Lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>2.</hi>

over Nature, but in her matter and motion, <hi>i. e.</hi> to put together, ſeparate, or faſhion natural Bodies, and ſomtimes to alter their ordinary courſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet neither ſhall I ſo ſtrictly tie my ſelf up to this method, but that I ſhall handle the two firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſeveral <hi>Species</hi> of natural things, and the errors of Nature in thoſe reſpective <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> together; and the things Artificial in the end apart: Method equally begetting iterations and prolixity, where it is obſerved too much, as where not at all. And theſe I intend to deliver as ſuccinctly as may be, in a plain, eaſie, unartificial Stile, ſtudiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avoiding all ornaments of Language, it being my purpoſe to treat of Things, and therefore would have the Reader expect nothing leſs then Words: Yet neither ſhall my Diſcourſe be ſo jejune, as wholly to conſiſt of bare Narrations, for where the ſubject has not at all, or but imperfectly been handled, I ſhall beg leave either to enlarge, or give my opinion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Since then the Celeſtial Bodies are ſo remote, that little can be known of them without the help of Art, and that all ſuch matters (according to my propoſed method) muſt be referred to the end of this Book: I have nothing of that kind to preſent the Reader with, that's local, and ſeparate from Art, but the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of two <hi>Parhelia</hi> or mock-Suns, one on each ſide of the true one, at <hi>Enſham</hi> on the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> early in the morning, in the year 1673. With them alſo appeared a great circle of light concentrical to the true Sun, and paſſing through the disks of the ſpurious ones, as in <hi>Tab.</hi> 1. <hi>Fig.</hi> 1. which though I ſaw not the <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> is as truly drawn (for ſo it was confeſt by ſome that did) as I could poſſibly have done it if perſonally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and yet ſo incurious was the amazed multitude, that they could not ſo much as give me ground to gueſs at the <hi>diameter</hi> of the circle, much leſs whether it were interrupted in ſome of its parts, or interſected (as they uſually are) with any other circles of a fainter colour.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Whether theſe appearances are cauſed by reflection or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction in the Clouds, according to the old Philoſophy; or by both, in a great annulary cake of Ice and Snow, as <hi>Des Cartes;</hi> or by ſemiopaque <hi>Cylinders,</hi> as <hi>M. Hugens de Zulichem,</hi> will be too too tedious hereto diſpute. Let it therefore at preſent ſuffice, that this <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> is worthy our notice, in regard,

That whereas generally ſuch mock-Suns appear not ſo bright, nor are ſo well defined as the true one is; theſe according to the agreement of all, appeared of ſo even and ſtrong a light, that 'twas hard to diſtinguiſh the true from the falſe, and perhaps might not be inferior to the <hi>Parhelia</hi> mention'd by <hi>Cardan</hi>

When they appear thus bright and illuſtrious, Aſtrologers heretofore always preſaged a Triumvirate: thus the Triumvirate of <hi>Antonius, Auguſtus,</hi> and <hi>Lepidus,</hi> with all the evils that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it, was referred to the <hi>Parhelia</hi> ſeen a little before; and herein <hi>Cardan</hi> is ſo poſitive, that he fears not to aſſert, That after ſuch an appearance, we ſeldom (if ever) fail of one, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore refers the <hi>Parhelia</hi> ſeen by himſelf to the Triumvirate of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond King of <hi>France, Charles</hi> the fifth, and <hi>Solyman</hi> the Turkiſh Emperor. And truly, were not theſe to be more than ſuſpected of vanity, it were eaſie to adapt a Triumvirate to ours: But my Religion, and that God that hath exhorted us, <hi>not to be diſmayed at the ſigns of Heaven,</hi> and ſolemnly profeſſes, that 'tis even He <hi>that fruſtrates the tokens of the Lyars, and makes the Diviners mad</hi>

colour, entire and well determined, which continued ſo for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout half an hour after I firſt ſaw it. The reaſon why ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear not of divers colours, as Rain-bows do that are made by the Sun, has been alwaies aſcribed by Philoſophers, to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Moons raies, not entring ſo deeply into the opacity of the clouds.

As for ours, though I could not perceive in any part of it, that it had the leaſt ſhade of any colour but white; however, I thought it not unworthy our notice, not only for the infrequency of the thing (they never happening but at or near the Moons full, and then but ſo very ſeldom too, that<note n="m" place="bottom">

From the Firmament (waving all conſiderations of the pure <hi>Aether,</hi> of which we know ſo little, that I ſhall ſay nothing) I naturally deſcend to the loweſt Heaven, I mean that ſubtile Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that immediatly incompaſſes the Earth, and is filled with all manner of exhalations, and from thence commonly known by the name of the <hi>Atmoſphere.</hi> Whether beſide theſe exhalations, there be any peculiar ſimple body, called Air, I leave to the more ſubtile Philoſophers, and conſider it here only, as 'tis the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ſtorms, of thunder and wind, of <hi>Echo's,</hi> and as it has relation to ſickneſs and health.</p>
               <p n="9">9. As to Tempeſts that have happen'd in this County, though perhaps there have been ſome heretofore attended with as deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable effects as any where elſe; yet becauſe they are no where tranſmitted to poſterity, I ſhall only mention two within our memory, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſtorm of wind that happen'd one night in <hi>February, Anno</hi> 1661/2, which though general (at leaſt all over
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:172327:15"/>
                  <hi>England</hi>) yet was remarkable at <hi>Oxon:</hi> in theſe two reſpects. 1. That though it forced the ſtones inwards into the cavity of <hi>All-hollows</hi> Spire, yet it over-threw it not. And 2<hi rend="sup">ly,</hi> That in the morning, when there was ſome abatement of its fury, it was yet ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that it laved water out of the River <hi>Cherwell,</hi> and caſt it quite over the Bridge at <hi>Magdalen</hi> College, above the ſurface of the River near 20 foot high; which paſſage, with advantage of holding by the College walls, I had then the curioſity to go ſee my ſelf, which otherwiſe, perhaps, I ſhould have as hardly cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited as ſome other perſons now may do. But thoſe that have ſailed to the <hi>Indies</hi> can inform them what force <hi>Hurricane's</hi> and <hi>Turbo's</hi> have, with what violence and impetuoſity they take up whole Seas of water, and furiouſly mount them into the air.<note n="n" place="bottom">It was obſerved by an able Sea-man of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> that this wind was the fag-end of a <hi>Hurricane,</hi> which began in New-<hi>England</hi> about three hours before it came hither; the Sea-men obſerv'd that it went directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> Now that ſuch as theſe may alſo happen at Land (though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for the moſt part of leſs ſtrength) I think we have little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to doubt, ſince our own Chronicles inform us, that in Q. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> time, within a mile of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> all the houſes of two little Pariſhes, with their Churches, were wholly born down by ſuch a Tempeſt; and the water, with the mud from the bottom of the River <hi>Trent,</hi> that ran between them, carryed a quarter of a mile and caſt againſt Trees, with the violence whereof they were torn up by the roots.</p>

As for <hi>Polyſyllabical articulate Echo's,</hi> the ſtrongeſt and beſt I have met with here, is in the Park at <hi>Woodſtock,</hi> which in the day time, little wind being ſtirring, returns very diſtinctly ſeventeen ſyllables, and in the night twenty: I made experiment of it with theſe words,
<q>
                     <l>—Quae nec reticere loquenti,</l>
                     <l>Nec prior ipſa loqui didicit reſonabilis Echo.</l>
                  </q>
In the day it would return only the laſt verſe, but in the night a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twelve by the clock, I could alſo hear the laſt word of the former <hi>Hemiſtick [loquenti.]</hi> The object of which <hi>Echo,</hi> or the <hi>Centrum phonocampticum,</hi> I take to be the hill with the trees on the <hi>ſummit</hi> of it, about half a mile diſtant from <hi>Woodstock</hi> town, in the way thence to the Right Honorable the Earl of <hi>Rocheſter</hi>'s Lodge: And the true place of the Speaker, or <hi>Centrum phonicum,</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:172327:17"/>
the oppoſite Hill juſt without the gate at the Towns end, about thirty paces directly below the corner of a wall incloſing ſome hay-ricks, near <hi>Chaucers</hi> houſe: ſome advantage I gueſs it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from the rivulet that runs as it were in a direct line between the two centers, and from the pond at the foot of the object hill; as alſo from two other hills that run obliquely up to it: Which may better be apprehended by the proſpect of the place, as in <hi>Tab.</hi> 1. <hi>Fig.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p n="16">16. That this <hi>Echo</hi> makes return of ſo many ſyllables, and of a different number in the day and night, being indiſputable and matter of fact; I proceed in the next place to the reaſons of theſe certainties, which poſſibly to every body may not be ſo plain. Firſt then, the cauſes why ſome <hi>Echo's</hi> return more, and ſome fewer ſyllables, I take to lye in the different diſtances of the objects (returning the voices) from the places of the ſpeakers: for by experience 'tis found, that if the ſpeaker be too near the object, the return is made ſo quick upon him, that the <hi>Echo</hi> is as it were drowned in the voice: but if he remove farther from it, then it begins to be clear and diſtinct; and if it be a <hi>polyſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bical</hi> one, it firſt repeats one ſyllable, then two, three, four, five, or more, according as the ſpeaker removes farther off it, which I take to be the only true way of meaſuring the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſpaces of the ground, requiſite for the return of one or more ſyllables. That this is true, I ſhall uſe no arguments to perſwade, becauſe the experiment is ſubject to every mans tryal; and if ſo, it muſt neceſſarily be admitted, that the reaſon why this <hi>Echo</hi> returns ſo much, is becauſe of the great diſtance of the object from the ſpeaker.</p>
               <p n="17">17. What diſtance is required to the return of each ſyllable, is beſt indeed determined by ſuch a procedure, where the object is fore-known, and the condition of the place will admit of the experiment: but both theſe being wanting here (<hi>Echo</hi>'s them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves being generally firſt known, and not the objects) I was forced to make uſe of a new <hi>analytical</hi> method, and find out the object by the number of ſyllables already returned, which being ſeventeen in the day time, and twenty by night; and having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore found by frequent experience, that according to <hi>Blancanus</hi>
                  <note n="s" place="bottom">Blancani Echometria Theorem <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note>, no one ſyllable will be returned clearly, under the diſtance of 24
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:172327:17"/>
Geometrical paces, or 120 feet, I gueſs'd that the object could not be removed leſs than 400 of the former, and 2000 of the latter. For the better underſtanding of which <hi>Analyſis,</hi> and for the Readers more ſecure finding of the true diſtance of the ſpeaker in any other place, it may be convenient that he take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that all <hi>Echo's</hi> have ſome one place whither they are return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtronger, and more diſtinct than any other, and is always the place that lies at right angles with the object, and is not too near, or too far off: for if a man ſtand at oblique angles with it, the voice is better returned to ſome other perſon at another place, than to the ſpeaker; and ſo if he ſtand too near, or far off, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he do ſtand at right angles with it, which is plain by the <hi>diagram, Tab.</hi> 1. <hi>Fig.</hi> 3. where

                  </list>
Now the ſpeaker ſtanding in <hi>a,</hi> and his voice going in the ſtraight line <hi>a b,</hi> and ſtriking upon the object ſo as to make right angles with it, muſt needs return to the ſpeaker again in the ſame line, and no farther, becauſe he is ſuppos'd to ſtand at the two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams of the whole mix'd line of action: but if he ſtand too near at <hi>h,</hi> then the <hi>Echo</hi> repeats more ſyllables, and diſtincter at <hi>g</hi> than either at <hi>h</hi> or <hi>a,</hi> becauſe <hi>g</hi> is now the extream of the line of action; for by how much the nearer the ſpeaker is to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, by ſo much the more forcible he ſtrikes it, which cauſes the rebound to be ſo much beyond him: and thus if he ſtand as much too far off, as at <hi>g,</hi> then the <hi>Echo</hi> repeats more ſyllables and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincter at <hi>h,</hi> then either at <hi>a</hi> or <hi>g,</hi> becauſe the diſtance being too great from <hi>g</hi> to <hi>b,</hi> and the reflexion weak, the <hi>Echo</hi> muſt needs terminate ſo much the ſhorter at <hi>h;</hi> all theſe being ſuppoſed to take up the whole line of the voices direct and reflex action. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, if the ſpeaker ſtand in <hi>c</hi> obliquely to the object, the <hi>Echo</hi> is better heard at <hi>d,</hi> than either at <hi>a</hi> or <hi>c;</hi> and ſo if he ſtand at <hi>d,</hi> it is better heard at <hi>c</hi> then any other place: thus if he ſtand at <hi>e</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:172327:18"/>
above the object, the <hi>Echo</hi> is beſt heard in the valley <hi>f, &amp; vice verſâ.</hi> All which, may be well enough made out by throwing a ball againſt a wall, to which, if it be thrown in an oblique line, it returns not to the thrower but to another place; and though the projicient do ſo throw it, that it ſtrikes at right angles with the wall, yet (like as in the voice) if he ſtand too far off, it will fall as much too ſhort in the rebound, as it will exceed if he ſtand too near.</p>
               <p n="18">18. According to theſe grounds I carefully examined this <hi>Echo,</hi> and found, upon motion backward, forward, and to each hand, the true <hi>centrum phonicum,</hi> or place of the ſpeaker, to be upon the hill at <hi>Woodſtock</hi> towns end, about thirty paces below the corner of the wall aforeſaid, directly down toward the <hi>Kings Majeſties</hi> Manor: from whence by meaſure to the brow of the hill, on which my Lord <hi>Rocheſters</hi> Lodge ſtands, are 456 Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical paces, or 2280 feet; which upon allowance of 24 Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical paces, or 120 feet to each ſyllable, to my great ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction I found to be agreeable to the return of 19 ſyllables, <hi>viz.</hi> one fewer than it returns in the night, and two more than in the day.</p>
               <p n="19">19. The meaſure I muſt confeſs had been much more eaſie and natural, could I have began from the object, and ſo removed backward accordingly as the <hi>Echo</hi> gradually increaſed in the repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of more ſyllables; for then I could have given the due proportion to each, if I had found any inequality upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, which I gueſs there may be, becauſe the allowance of an equality ſeems to ſet the object too far off by a ſyllable or two. But it not being feaſible in this place, I was forced to take the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer courſe; for in the valley between the two hills, being the whole <hi>medium</hi> through which the voice paſſes, and the <hi>Echo</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns it, there is ſcarce any ſuch thing as an <hi>Echo</hi> to be found; nay, if you ſtand at the Manor it ſelf, which is not far from the true place of the ſpeaker, and ſituate almoſt as high, and direct your voice toward the place of the object, you ſhall not have the leaſt return; whence 'tis moſt evident that I could not uſe that procedure here, and therefore muſt deſire to be held excuſed from giving the proportions of ſpace, which I ſuppoſe, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Kircher</hi>

increaſe, till I meet with an <hi>Echo</hi> fit for the purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="20">20. The reaſon of the difference between day and night, why it ſhould return ſeventeen ſyllables in the one, and twenty in the other, may lie, I ſuppoſe, in the various qualities, and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the <hi>medium</hi> in different ſeaſons; the Air being much more quiet, and ſtock'd with exhalations in the night than day, which ſomthing retarding the quick motion of the voice to the object, and its return to the ſpeaker ſomwhat more, (by reaſon the voice muſt needs be weakned in the reflexion) muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give ſpace for the return of more ſyllables.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Amongſt other tryals of this <hi>Echo,</hi> I diſcharged a Piſtol, which made a return much quicker then my voice, and (at which I ſtill wonder) with a much different ſound from that the Piſtol made, whence I can only conclude, that the more forcibly the Air is ſtricken, (as alſo in the projection of a ball) the ſooner the reſponſe is made, and that poſſibly there may be ſome ſounds more agreeable to every <hi>Echo,</hi> than others. And it being my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>'s opinion, That there are ſome letters that an <hi>Echo</hi> will hardly expreſs, and particularly the letter S, which, ſaies he, being of an interior and hiſſing ſound, the <hi>Echo</hi> at <hi>Pont Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renton</hi> would not return<note n="u" place="bottom">Nat.

Theſe I muſt confeſs are but <hi>Echo's</hi> improperly ſo called, becauſe they will expreſs nothing that's articulate, and therefore rather fall under the notation of a <hi>Bombus;</hi> yet their cauſe being ſomwhat nice and ſubtile, I thought not fit to paſs them by, but to take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion from hence to advertiſe the Reader, that there are ſome other inanimate Bodies beſide the <hi>Load-ſtone,</hi> that though they have no ſenſe, yet have a ſort of perception, which I take to be ſufficiently proved from theſe Vaults, that ſeem to have a kind of election to embrace what is agreeable, and exclude all that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate to them: thus are the very ſeats in Churches and Chappels affected with ſome peculiar Notes of the <hi>Organ;</hi> and I have a friend (a Violiſt) whom I dare believe, that ſays, his Thigh is thus ſenſible of a peculiar Note, as oft as he lights on it during his playing. Some have imputed much of this in Buildings, to the figure and accurate ſtructure of the Arch, and that where they have different ſhapes and magnitudes, there will be different tunings alſo: But I do not find it agreeable to experience, there being another Vault in the entrance into <hi>Merton College</hi> Chappel, much leſs, and of a far different figure from that other before mentioned in the ſame <hi>College,</hi> which returns very near, if not exactly the ſame Note: And ſo do the Gates of <hi>Queens</hi> and <hi>

Gemitu nemus omne remugit,</hi> and allow, as before, for the return of each ſyllable 120 feet, the firſt object muſt be 1200 feet off; and the ſecond, with abatement for diſtance, at leaſt 2000; and the third, certainly out of the voices reach, beyond all hopes of any reſponſe. Indeed, could we meet with one of <hi>Merſennus</hi>'s <hi>Echo's,</hi> where ſixty nine feet would return us a ſyllable, then ſuch an <hi>Hemiſtick</hi> might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounded three times, or perhaps a whole <hi>Hexameter</hi> twice; yet however ſmall a ſpace may be found for the clear repetition of ſuch a Verſe, I cannot think it can poſſibly be, that any <hi>Echo</hi> ſhould repeat one eight times over: for ſuppoſe a ſmaller diſtance would ſuffice, then that allowed by <hi>Merſennus,</hi> as but 350 yards to a Verſe of ſeventeen ſyllables, and allowing ſome decreaſe for the objects diſtances; yet I do not doubt, but two or
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:172327:20"/>
three of the furtheſt muſt needs be out of the voices action.</p>
               <p n="26">26. Much leſs ſure can any ſingle object perform this, and yet <hi>Jacobus Boiſſardus,</hi> in his <hi>Topography</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> reports this to be true upon his own knowledge. <hi>On the</hi> Appian <hi>way</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>amongſt many other vaſt ruins, which ſome think to have been the Caſtle wherein the</hi> Praetorian <hi>Soldiers lay, there are many Sepulchers, obtuſe and ſolid</hi> Pyramids, <hi>&amp;c.

But though we have no conſiderable <hi>Tautological Echo's,</hi> by a ſimple reflection, yet we have others of no inferior account made by a double one, which alſo ariſing from divers objects, though in a different manner, belong to this place.

                  <hi>Pawling</hi> Mercer of <hi>Oxon:</hi> there is a wall of about 40 yards long, built for the advantage of the Fruit, with divers <hi>Niches;</hi> to which, if you ſtand but a little obliquely, ſo as to ſee the <hi>Peers</hi> ſtanding out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween each two of them, you have the ſeveral objects of ſuch an <hi>Echo,</hi> not above nine or ten foot diſtant from each other, which return a clap with the hand, or a <hi>monoſyllable</hi> (the wind being

quiet and ſtill) at leaſt nine, if not ten or eleven times, but ſo thick and cloſe, that even a <hi>diſſyllable</hi> breeds a confuſion: Where by the way if it be objected, that (the whole wall being but 40 yards, or 120 foot long) according to the afore-limited diſtance for <hi>Echo's,</hi> a <hi>monoſyllable</hi> ſhould not be returned above once at moſt: It is to be noted, that theſe <hi>Echo's</hi> made by a double re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, begin (quite contrary to all others) at the remoteſt object from the <hi>corpus ſonorum,</hi> which in as many as I have yet ſeen, is a diſtinct wall, falling on that; on which the reſt of the objects are, in right angles; and this object it is, that firſt terminates the voice, clap, or ſtamp; and from which, by reflection, they next ſtrike the <hi>ultimate</hi> ſecondary object, then the <hi>penultimate</hi> and <hi>antepenultimate;</hi> which, though nearer to the <hi>corpus ſonorum</hi> in reſpect of the ſituation of the objects, yet are ſtill further off in reſpect of the voice, or other ſounds motion: whence it comes to paſs, that the neareſt object to the <hi>corpus ſonorum</hi> is laſt ſtricken, and therefore repeats a ſyllable as well as any of the reſt, becauſe indeed in that reſpect the furtheſt from it.</p>

But herein let it be noted, that I am not ſo ſanguine as to exclude all fears that it may be otherwiſe, but only ſuggeſt what ſeems moſt probable at preſent, <hi>cum animo revocandi,</hi> whenever I ſhall be better informed by another, or my own future experience.</p>
               <p n="30">30. At <hi>New College</hi> in the Cloyſters, there are others of this kind, to be heard indeed on all ſides, but beſt on the <hi>South</hi> and <hi>Weſt,</hi> becauſe on thoſe there are no doors either to interrupt or waſt the ſound: Theſe return a ſtamp or voice, ſeven, eight, or nine times, which ſo plainly is occaſion'd by the <hi>Peers</hi> between the windows, that on the <hi>Weſt</hi> and ſhorter ſide (being but 38 yards long) the returns are more quick and thicker by much than on the <hi>South,</hi> where the primary object being above fifty yards removed from the <hi>corpus ſonorum,</hi> and the ſecondary ones propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably further; the returns are much ſlower and more diſtinct, in ſo much that on that ſide the <hi>Echo</hi> will return a <hi>diſſyllable,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the <hi>Weſt</hi> ſide you can have but a <hi>monoſyllable</hi> only.

               <p>THAT <hi>Oxford-ſhire</hi> is the beſt <hi>water'd County</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> though I dare not with too much confidence aſſert, yet am induced to believe there are few better; ſince beſide the five more conſiderable Rivers of <hi>Thame, Iſis, Cherwell, Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lode,</hi> and <hi>Windruſh,</hi> there are numbred no leſs than threeſcore and ten at leaſt of an inferior rank, beſide ſmaller Brooks not worthy notice: And all theſe of ſo quick a ſtream, and free from ſtagnation, ſo clear, and yet ſo well impregnated with wholſom primogenial Steams of <hi>Salts</hi> and <hi>Sulphurs,</hi> that few (if any) vappid and ſtinking Exhalations can aſcend from them to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the <hi>Air.</hi> As for ſtanding Pools, Mariſh, or Boggy grounds, the parents (at leaſt occaſions) of <hi>Agues, Coughs, Catarhs,</hi> they are feweſt here of any place to be found: the Soyl for the moſt part lying dry, and water'd only with clear and rapid Fountains. In ſhort, ſo altogether agreeable is this County to <hi>Cardans</hi>

And if plenty of whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Fiſh, ſpontaneous productions of odoriferous Plants, and the ſcarcity of filthy <hi>Reptils,</hi> be cogent Arguments of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Waters,</hi> Soyls, and conſequently of <hi>Air,</hi> as heretofore they have been accounted, I know not the place can make better pretences, as ſhall be ſhewn more at large in their proper places.</p>

Beſide its clearneſs from peſtiferous vapors, I take the ſharpneſs we find this <hi>Air</hi> to be of, to be no ſmall argument of its health and purity. <hi>Aristotle,</hi> 'tis true, thought <hi>Air</hi> mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately warm, but its conſtant return to a brisk coldneſs, after it has been heated either by fire, the Sun, or warm exhalations, gives us ſtrong ſuſpitions that 'tis naturally cold: All natural Bodies, after they have ſuffered violence, returning of themſelves to their innate condition. To which add, that the <hi>Air</hi> on the tops of high Mountains, above the reach of the Clouds and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther warm Exhalations, as 'tis found to be clear, ſo 'tis very
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:172327:23"/>
cold; whence I think it may not be <hi>illogically</hi> concluded, That the colder the <hi>Air,</hi> the nearer to purity, and conſequentially more healthy: Which is alſo very ſuitable to the doctrine of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> who ſpeaking concerning the healthy ſituation of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſays, <hi>That ſuch which are placed to cold winds,</hi>

               <p n="6">6. There is a MSS. in Sir <hi>Robert Cottons</hi> Library, that gives an account of this <hi>Parliament,</hi> which, it ſaies, conſiſted of the chief of all Orders of the Kingdom, and was called at <hi>Sifford</hi> (now <hi>Shifford</hi>) in <hi>Oxford-ſhire,</hi> by King <hi>Alfred,</hi> where the <hi>King</hi> as Head conſulted with the <hi>Clergy, Nobles,</hi> and others, about the maners and government of the people, where he delivered ſome grave admonitions concerning the ſame: The words of the MSS. are theſe,

now <hi>Katlage</hi> in <hi>Cambridge-ſhire;</hi> but I rather believe it was held here, not only for the ſake of the name, which remains the ſame to this day, but becauſe of the one and only Conſtitution made there, <hi>viz.

               <p n="8">8. From whence (after ſo long, but I hope not unpleaſant di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion) I return to the Beautiful <hi>Oxford</hi> again, a place of ſo ſweet and wholſom an <hi>Air,</hi> that though it muſt not be compared with that of <hi>Montpellier,</hi> yet upon my own knowledge it has proved ſo advantagious to ſome, that it has prefectly recovered them of deep Conſumptions; and particularly a worthy Friend of mine, who though he came hither ſufficiently ſpent, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of any other <hi>Phyſick,</hi> within few <hi>Months</hi> felt a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible amendment; and in fewer <hi>Years</hi> became of as ſanguine a complexion as the reſt of his friends, that had almoſt deſpaired of him.</p>

                  </note> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of an ingenious Perſon that reſided long in the Iſland <hi>Japan,</hi> That though the Air be very ſalubrious there, yet the <hi>Small Pox</hi> and <hi>Fluxes</hi> are very frequent, but the <hi>Plague</hi> not ſo much as ever heard of; which has often made me reflect on the year 1665, when the <hi>Peſtilence</hi> was ſpread in a maner all over the Kingdom, that even then, though the Court, both Houſes of Parliament, and the Term were kept at <hi>Oxford,</hi> the <hi>Plague</hi> notwithſtanding was not there at all.</p>
               <p n="10">10.

'Tis true, that <hi>Oxford</hi> was much more unhealthy hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then now it is, by reaſon the City was then much leſs, and the Scholars many more, who when crowded up in ſo narrow a ſpace, and the then ſlovenly Towns-men not keeping the ſtreet clean, but killing all maner of Cattle within the walls, did ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the place much more unhealthy.

                  </note>; the Town hath ever ſince continued in a healthful condition: though I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but believe, but were there yet more Trenches cut in ſome of the Meddows, the Air might be ſomwhat better'd ſtill, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially during the Winter ſeaſon, when I fear ſomtimes Floods ſtay a little too long, and that not only near <hi>Oxford,</hi> but in <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moor;</hi> and all along the <hi>Iſis</hi> from <hi>Enſham</hi> to <hi>North-moor, Shifford, Chimly,</hi> and <hi>Rotcot,</hi> which brings me again to the general conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Waters as well of the whole County as City.</p>

But as to the matter of Fact, as I cannot but think it hard that ſo many people ſhould agree in a falſity, ſo methinks 'tis as diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult they ſhould miſtake in their judgments, ſince I was told by one of the ſobereſt of that <hi>calling,</hi> that he once knew a Hatchet caſually fall over-board into the River near <hi>Wallingford,</hi> which was afterwards brought up, and found in one of theſe <hi>Ice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meers.</hi>

That the two conſiderable <hi>Rivers</hi> of <hi>Stour</hi> and <hi>Ouſe,</hi> though but ſmall here and running but little way in it, yet riſe in this <hi>County;</hi> the one at <hi>Swalcliff,</hi> which goes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Severn</hi> Sea in the <hi>weſt;</hi> and the other at <hi>Fritwell,</hi> whence it runs into the Sea between <hi>Lincoln-ſhire</hi> and <hi>Norfolk</hi> in the <hi>eaſt</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> And (2.) that the Fountain-heads of the River <hi>Rea</hi> lye for the moſt part in a plain Country, having little more to feed them, than juſt a declivity to facilitate their paſſage; which ſeems to argue, that all running <hi>waters</hi> owe not their continuance to rain and dews, collected as they ſay, on the ſpungy tops of hills, and ſent forth again ſomwhere in the declivity. And ſo do's a a ſmall Spring at <hi>Cleydon,</hi> that riſes in the ſtreet on the <hi>ſouth</hi> ſide of the Town, which continues running all the year, but moſt plentifully like the <hi>Scatebra</hi> of <hi>Pliny</hi>

               <p n="18">18. That <hi>Land-ſprings,</hi> and ſuch as run but once perpahs in many years, have their riſe and continuance from plentiful ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,

I think we have little reaſon to doubt, ſince we have them not at all, or but very weak in any Summer, or the dryer Winters: ſuch are thoſe that fore-tell (and naturally enough) the ſcarcity and dearneſs of Corn and Victuals; whereof that of <hi>Aſſenton,</hi> near <hi>Henly</hi> upon <hi>Thames,</hi> is one of the moſt eminent that I know of in <hi>England;</hi> and no queſtion is the ſame mentioned by <hi>Johannes Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeb.

Of theſe there are many in the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> which I know not for what reaſon they call <hi>Nailbourns</hi> there, and preſcribe them (ſome will) a certain time for their running, as once in ſeven, ten, or fifteen years. But the certain natural principle of ſuch Springs, altogether depending upon an uncertain cauſe, no heed is to be given to ſuch kind of ſtories, they being equally as vain as the perſons that broach'd them.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Beſide theſe conſtant and intermitting <hi>Rivulets,</hi> that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways diſcharge themſelves into Seas or Lakes, we have others here of a peculiar kind that empty themſelves into neither of them: but as they firſt roſe out of the Earth, ſo preſently after a ſhort ſtay on it, ingulf themſelves again, and are no more ſeen. Two of theſe there are at <hi>Shot-over Foreſt,</hi> both riſing as I take it on the <hi>north</hi> ſide of the hill; the one not far from <hi>Hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington</hi> Quarry-pits, is conſtantly fed with a double Spring, yet after it has run about two Bows ſhoot, is received by a <hi>rocky ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous indraught,</hi> and appears no more: for though ſome have thought it to come forth again at the Pool of a Mill not far from it, yet after diligent ſearch I could find no ſuch matter. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there is not far from <hi>Foreſt-hill,</hi> and I think in the Grounds of Sir <hi>Timothy Tyrrill,</hi> which ſomtimes in Winter runs with that violence, and has worn its <hi>In-let</hi> to ſuch a capacity, that it can and has received an <hi>Ox.</hi>

Other <hi>waters</hi> again are of ſo ſlow a pace, that they ſeem rather to ſweat than run out of the Earth, part whereof being ſpent in <hi>exhalation,</hi> and the reſt in ſating the dry neighboring Earth, do neither reach the Sea, are received in Lakes, nor ſwallowed up like the former, but of themſelves are ſtopt upon the very ſurface. And yet I have obſerved, and believe rightly too, that theſe are the moſt durable <hi>Land ſprings</hi> we have, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that famous one of this kind at <hi>Nettlebed,</hi> which I know not from what old <hi>Witch</hi> heretofore, by way of deriſion, they call <hi>Mother Hibblemeer;</hi> whereas if we conſider how ſerviceable ſhe has been, being never known to fail them in the dryeſt Summer, and that in a Country ſo uncapable of Wells, that there's no ſuch thing to be found in the Pariſh, ſhe rather merits the eſteem of the <hi>Nymph</hi> of the place.</p>
               <p n="21">21. In <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> they have a Spring they call their <hi>Bolderborn</hi>

                  </note>, from a noiſe that it makes at the <hi>exit</hi> of the water; whether ours may deſerve the name, I know not, but ſuch a one there is in the Pariſh of <hi>Glympton,</hi> in a wood about a mile <hi>ſouth-weſt</hi> from the Church, in a place where there are ſtones in the form of Cockles; upon which account hereafter I ſhall mention it again. The <hi>Springs,</hi> as I remember, are in number three, and the moſt <hi>ſouthern</hi> one of theſe 'tis that has the humming noiſe, much like that of an empty bottle held with the mouth againſt the wind, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may be a reſemblance ſo befitting our purpoſe, that it may help to explain the cauſe as well as the ſound: for provided the channel be large within, and the paſſage forth ſomwhat narrow like a bottle, the colliſion of the water againſt the lips of the <hi>orifice,</hi> may well make a noiſe in a large vault within, eſpecially if the waters be indued with a ſpirit, as peradventure anon may be proved like enough.</p>
               <p n="22">22.

               <p n="23">23. Of <hi>Petrifying waters,</hi> though I doubt not but their kinds are as various, as the effects they produce; and the effects again, as the ſubjects they work on; yet I am inclined to believe that they all agree thus far, that they proceed in the main from the ſame ſtock and linage, and are all more or leſs of the kindred of <hi>Salts,</hi> which ſublimed and rarified in the bowels of the Earth into an inviſible ſteam, are received by the <hi>waters</hi> as their moſt agreeable <hi>vehicle,</hi> and brought hither to us at the riſing of <hi>Springs,</hi> as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibly as the particles of ſilver or gold, when each is diſſolved in its proper <hi>menſtruum:</hi> where meeting perchance with an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient <hi>Air,</hi> much colder and chilling than any under ground, in all likelyhood are <hi>precipitated,</hi> and thrown down on ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as they caſually find at the place of their <hi>exit,</hi> which they preſently cloath with a cruſt of ſtone; or elſe (where <hi>precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>coheſion</hi> will not ſuffice) they paſs with the <hi>waters</hi> through the <hi>pores</hi> of the ſubjects, and are left behind in them juſt as in a <hi>filter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="24">24. The reaſon of which difference may probably be, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſome of theſe <hi>petrifying</hi> ſteams or <hi>atoms,</hi> may be groſs and more bulky than ſome others are, and cannot be held up in the watry <hi>vehicle,</hi> without ſuch a heat as they have under ground, but fall, and by reaſon of their bigneſs, do not <hi>penetrate,</hi> but <hi>adhere</hi> to their ſubjects; whereas others that are fine, more minute and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, are eaſily ſupported in a <hi>volatile</hi> condition, and paſs with the waters into the cloſeſt <hi>textures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="25">25. If any body doubt whether ſtones, and ſo <hi>petrifications,</hi> ariſe from <hi>Salts,</hi> let him but conſult the <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> and aſk, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they find not all <hi>indurated</hi> Bodies, ſuch as ſtones, bones, ſhells, and the like, moſt highly ſated with the <hi>ſaline</hi> principle? Some mixture of <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi> 'tis true there is in them, which give the <hi>opacity</hi> that moſt ſtones have; from which, according as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:172327:30"/>
they are more or leſs free, they have <hi>proportionable transparency,</hi> and ſom hardneſs too; as the beſt of gems, the <hi>Diamant,</hi> evinces. And if he ſhall ask what <hi>Salts</hi> are the apteſt to perform this feat of <hi>petrification,</hi> though the difficulty of the queſtion might well excuſe me, yet I'le venture thus far to give him an anſwer, That I have frequently ſeen at <hi>Whitſtable</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> how their <hi>Coperas</hi> or <hi>Vitriol</hi> is made out of ſtones that 'tis more then probable were firſt made out of <hi>that:</hi> to the Spirit of which <hi>Vitriol</hi> if you add Oyl of <hi>Tartar,</hi> they preſently turn into a fix'd and ſomwhat hard ſubſtance, not much inferior or unlike to ſome <hi>incruſtations;</hi> which ſeems to conclude, that from theſe two, all ſuch like <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions</hi> are probably made; and that could we but admit that <hi>Ocean</hi> of <hi>Tartar,</hi> which <hi>Plato</hi>

To which I alſo add in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> what's matter of fact, and prevails with me much, That where-ever I find ſtrong <hi>Vitriol</hi> waters, the <hi>petrifying</hi> ones are ſeldom far off; which as far as I have obſerved, I believe may be reduced to theſe three kinds that preſently follow.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Such as purely of themſelves are <hi>petrifyed,</hi> the very body of <hi>water</hi> being turned into ſtone as it drops from the rocks, which we therefore commonly call <hi>Lapides ſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latitios,</hi> and ſhall accordingly treat of them in the <hi>Chapter of Stones,</hi> theſe not ſtrictly coming under <hi>petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications,</hi> where beſide the <hi>water</hi> and <hi>ſaxeous odour,</hi> there is always required a ſubject to work on of a diſtinct <hi>ſpecies</hi> from either of the two; as in</item>

               <p n="26">26. <hi>Incruſtations,</hi> are <hi>petrifications</hi> made by ſuch <hi>waters</hi> as let fall their ſtony particles, which becauſe either of their own big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or cloſeneſs of the <hi>pores</hi> and <hi>texture</hi> of the Body on which they fall, are fixt only to the <hi>ſuperficial parts,</hi> as it were, by <hi>ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,</hi> and do not enter the ſolid body; of which I have met with ſeveral in <hi>Oxford-ſhire,</hi> and particularly at <hi>Sommerton,</hi> as was above-mentioned, where the graſs, being one of the <hi>fluvia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilia,</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:172327:31"/>
is covered over with a ſoft ſtone; and yet ſo, that broken off, the graſs appeared (for any thing I could ſee) as freſh and green as any other not <hi>cruſted,</hi> nothing of the blade being alter'd or impaired, which is the neareſt <hi>incruſtation</hi> I ever yet ſaw: for though ſome of theſe <hi>petrified</hi> blades of graſs hung down at leaſt a foot in length, yet ſlipping them off from about the root, I could take the graſs by the end, and pull it clean out as it were from a ſheath of ſtone, ſo little of <hi>coheſion</hi> had the one to the other: the reaſon of which I gueſs may be, that the <hi>pores</hi> of the Plant poſſeſt with its own juice, and already furniſh'd with a <hi>congenial ſalt,</hi> might well refuſe <hi>adventitious</hi> ones.</p>
               <p n="27">27. And yet far otherwiſe is it, but juſt on the other ſide the River at <hi>North-Aſhton,</hi> in a Field <hi>north-west</hi> of the Church, where either the <hi>petrifying</hi> water, or plants, are ſo different from what before I had found them at <hi>Sommerton,</hi> that though there too the work be begun by <hi>adheſion,</hi> yet the roots of <hi>ruſhes, graſs, moſs, &amp;c.</hi> are in a while ſo altogether eaten away, that nothing remains af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>petrification</hi> is compleated, but the figures of thoſe Plants with ſome augmentation.</p>
               <p n="28">28. And <hi>petrifications</hi> of this kind I frequently meet with, that happen on things of much different ſubſtances, as <hi>ſhells, nuts, leaves of trees,</hi> and many times on their moſt <hi>ligneous</hi> parts. In the Pariſh of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Clements</hi> in the Suburbs of <hi>Oxford,</hi> about a quarter of a mile diſtant, on the right hand of the firſt way that turns <hi>eaſt-ward</hi> out of <hi>Marſton-lane,</hi> there is a ditch, the water whereof <hi>incruſtates</hi> the ſticks that fall out of the hedge, and ſome other matters it meets with there: but this is ſo inconſiderable, that I ſhould not have mention'd it, but that it has been taken notice of by ſo many before, that my ſilence herein would have looked like a defect. Much better for this purpoſe is the water of a Pump at the <hi>Croſs-Inn</hi> near <hi>Carfax,</hi> in the City it ſelf, which not only <hi>incruſtates</hi> boards fallen into it, but inſerts it ſelf ſo intimately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the pores of the wood, that by degrees rotting it away, there is in the end the ſucceſſion of a perfect ſtone; and that not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome courſe repreſentation of the very lineaments of the wood it ſelf: Which though I muſt confeſs to be of ſomwhat a higher kind of <hi>petrification</hi> than <hi>incruſtation,</hi> yet it being wholly performed by acceſſion of parts, and continual intruſion into the open pores of rotten wood, will not amount to the warranty of a different <hi>ſpecies.</hi>

               <p n="34">34. At <hi>Henly</hi> they are troubled with many of them but not ſo much as they are at <hi>Thame;</hi> for there they have a way to let them ſtand two days, within which time (as I was informed by my worthy Friend M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

The reaſon, I
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:172327:32"/>
ſuppoſe, why the <hi>acid</hi> will not fall, as it do's at <hi>Henly</hi> and ſome other places, is becauſe theſe waters, beſide their ſalt, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability alſo hold a crude <hi>Sulphur,</hi> whoſe viſcous particles do ſo tenaciouſly embrace it, that it will not admit of any ſeparation; which may alſo perhaps be a hint to the cauſe why their Beer will ſtink within fourteen days whenever they attempt to brew with this <hi>water,</hi> for where a <hi>Sulphur</hi> is any thing great in quantity, and its body opened and exalted by the heat in brewing, and the active ſpirituous particles of Mault, (as I gueſs the caſe may have it ſelf here) the frame of that <hi>mixtion</hi> may probably be looſed, wherein the <hi>ſpirits</hi> firſt taking their flight, the <hi>Sulphur</hi> will next begin to <hi>evaporate,</hi> whoſe ſteams being ſmartly <hi>aculeated</hi> by the <hi>ſalt,</hi> that then bears the chief ſway in the ſubject, cauſe the ſtink of the Beer that is brewed with ſuch water.</p>
               <p n="35">35. Other waters there are that are palatably <hi>ſalt,</hi> and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſtinking without being brewed, and ſuch is that before-mentioned near <hi>Churchill</hi>-mill: but I think within the bounds of the Pariſh of <hi>Kingham;</hi> The water as it ſtands looks of a greeniſh colour, as moſt of the palatably <hi>ſalt</hi> waters do, and do it reſort all the Pigeons in the Country; which ſhould they not do, I ſhould much wonder, ſince beſides its ſaltneſs it has ſuch a ſtink, that it equals the <hi>ſalt ſtone,</hi> and <hi>roaſted dog</hi> too: ſo that ſhould the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor</hi> but build a Dove-houſe here, he might honeſtly rob all his neighbors of their flights; but that he may not put it to ſo invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious a uſe, I ſhall divert him anon by a more profitable way.</p>
               <p n="36">36. As to the <hi>ſalt</hi> that impregnates this <hi>water,</hi> I do not take it to be a ſimple one, but ſome Mineral <hi>concrete</hi> both of <hi>ſalt</hi> and <hi>ſulphur;</hi> for without theſe two be in their exaltation, and become ſo far fluid as to endeavor a divorce from each other, it could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver acquire ſo noiſom a ſmell. Which <hi>concrete</hi> ſhould I call a <hi>ſalt Marine,</hi> peradventure I might not be much miſtaken; for if you take but a ſmall quantity of thrice calcined <hi>Bay ſalt,</hi> and diſſolve it in a pint of Well-water, upon diſſolution you will have much ſuch an odour, as has been obſerved by a late Author in a ſhort account of the <hi>Sulphur</hi> Well at <hi>Knarsborough</hi>

What ſort of <hi>ſalt</hi> this is, I care not to determine, becauſe it will be difficult not to miſtake; for upon <hi>evaporation</hi> of about a gallon, it yielded a <hi>ſalt</hi> of a <hi>urinous</hi> taſt: which at firſt I muſt confeſs was ſo ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing to me, that I could not but think, that during my abſence, ſome waggiſh fellow had either put a trick on me, or elſe that I might have uſed ſome unfit veſſel; whereupon I cauſed a new earthen pot to be bought, well glaſed, and then repeated the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment very carefully, but found in the end all had been honeſt about me, for I had a <hi>ſalt</hi> again of the very ſame taſt.</p>

               <p n="42">42. I have often ſince wiſh'd, that I had tryed this <hi>water</hi> with a ſolution of <hi>Alum,</hi> and ſeen whether it would have given any thing of that milky precipitation it do's with <hi>

and paſſing through a blew Clay, adorned with ſome glittering ſparks; and meeting by the way with <hi>pyrites argenteus,</hi> and a bed of <hi>Belemnites,</hi> or (as they call them) Thunder-bolts, He came within few yards to this water, of a ſtrong <hi>ſulphureous</hi> ſmell, the moſt like of any thing I can think of, to the water that has been uſed in the ſcouring a foul gun: in weight lighter than pure Spring-water by an ℥<hi>js.</hi> in a quart, and yet after ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tryals, I found it ſo highly impregnated with a <hi>vitrioline ſalt</hi> as well as <hi>ſulphur,</hi> that two grains of the powder of <hi>galls</hi> would turn a gallon of <hi>water</hi> into a dusky red, inclining to purple; nor did they only ſo alter the <hi>ſite</hi> and poſition of the particles, as to give a different colour and conſiſtence, as it happens in <hi>waters</hi> but meanly ſated; but in a quarter of an hour did ſo condenſe and conſtipate the pores of the watery <hi>vehicle,</hi> that the excluded particles of the <hi>Minerals</hi> appeared in a ſeparate ſtate, curdled in the Veſſel, and of ſo weighty a ſubſtance, that they ſubſided to the bottom in a dark blue colour.</p>
               <p n="50">50.

during the time of <hi>winter,</hi> the pores of the Earth being ſtopt, and the <hi>Mineral</hi> thereby not permitted to exhale, the <hi>water</hi> is then impregnated with it, and gives the <hi>tincture;</hi> whereas in the <hi>ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> ſeaſon it expires ſo much, that the depauperated <hi>water</hi> can ſhew nothing of it.

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the Earths.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>OXFORD-SHIRE,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi>
                  <note n="o" place="bottom">Britan. in Oxfordſhire.</note>, is a <hi>fertile County and plentiful, the Plains garniſhed with Corn-fields and Meddows, and the Hills beſet with Woods; ſtored in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very place not only with Corn and Fruits, but alſo with all kind of Game for hound and hawk, and well water'd with Rivers plentiful of Fiſh.</hi> Which general deſcription of the <hi>Soil,</hi> though in the main it be true to this day, yet if we come to a more particular and cloſe conſideration of it, we ſhall find, that though <hi>Oxford-ſhire</hi> almoſt in every part, where the induſtry of the Huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath any thing ſhewed it ſelf, doth produce Corn of all ſorts plentifully enough; yet it has much more cauſe to <hi>brag</hi> of its <hi>Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,</hi> and abundance of <hi>Paſtures,</hi> wherein (as in Rivers) few Countrys may be compared, perhaps none preferr'd. And as to matter of <hi>Fruits,</hi> I think I may better aſſert of it what <hi>Giral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> do's of <hi>Ireland, Paſcuis tamen quam frugibus, gramine, quam grano, faecundior Comitatus,</hi> than groundleſly to commend it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Hills, 'tis true, before the late <hi>unhappy Wars,</hi> were well enough (as he ſays) beſet with <hi>Woods,</hi> where now 'tis ſo ſcarcy, that 'tis a common thing to ſell it by weight, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at <hi>Oxford,</hi> but at many other places in the Northern parts of the <hi>ſhire;</hi> where if brought to <hi>Mercat,</hi> it is ordinarily ſold for about <hi>one ſhilling the hundred,</hi> but if remote from a great Town, it may be had for <hi>ſeven pence:</hi> And thus it is every where but in the <hi>Chiltern Country,</hi> which remains to this day a <hi>woody</hi> Tract, and is (as I have very good ground to think) ſome of the <hi>weſtern</hi> part of the great <hi>Foreſt</hi> Andredesƿald, or Andredeslege, reaching, ſays <hi>Leland</hi>
                  <note n="p" place="bottom">Lelandi Comment. in Cyg. Cant. in verbo Limenus.</note>, from beſide <hi>Portus Limenus</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> a 120 miles <hi>weſtward,</hi> which happily falls out to be about this place: To which had <hi>Caeſar</hi> ever arrived, he had never ſure left us ſuch an account, as we find in his <hi>Commentaries</hi> concerning our <hi>Woods: Materia,</hi> ſays he, <hi>cujuſque generis, ut in Gallia, praeter Abietem &amp; fagum</hi>
                  <note n="q" place="bottom">De Bello Gallico, lib. <hi>5.</hi> ſub initium.</note>, i. e.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:172327:40"/>
                  <hi>that there was here all maner of wood, as in</hi> France, <hi>except the</hi> Fir <hi>and</hi> Beech: of the laſt whereof there is ſuch plenty in the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern,</hi> that they have now there-about ſcarce any thing elſe; but it lies ſo far from <hi>Oxford,</hi> and ſo near the River ſide, which eaſily conveys it to <hi>London</hi> Mercat, that 'tis ſcarce beneficial to the reſt of the <hi>County.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. As to the qualifications of the <hi>Soil</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Corn,</hi> I find them in goodneſs to differ much, and not only according to their ſeveral compoſitions (being in ſome places <hi>black,</hi> or <hi>reddiſh earth:</hi> in others a <hi>clay</hi> or <hi>chalky</hi> ground, ſome mixt of <hi>earth</hi> and <hi>ſand, clay</hi> and <hi>ſand, gravel</hi> and <hi>clay, &amp;c.</hi>) but chiefly according to the depth of the <hi>mould</hi> or uppermoſt <hi>coat</hi> of the earth, and the nature of the ground next immediatly under it: for let the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt <hi>mould</hi> be never ſo rich, if it have not ſome depth, or ſuch a ground juſt underneath it, as will permit <hi>all ſuperfluous moiſture to deſcend, and admit alſo the hot and comfortable ſteams to aſcend,</hi> it will not be ſo <hi>fertile</hi> as a much leaner <hi>ſoil</hi> that enjoys theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thus have I often-times ſeen in this <hi>County,</hi> in all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance a very good <hi>ſoil,</hi> and ſuch indeed as would otherwiſe have been really ſo, leſs <hi>fertile</hi> becauſe of its ſhallowneſs, and a cold <hi>ſtiff clay,</hi> or cloſe <hi>free-ſtone</hi> next under-neath it, than a much poorer Land of ſome conſiderable depth, and lying over a <hi>ſand</hi> or <hi>gravel,</hi> through which all <hi>ſuperfluous moisture</hi> might deſcend, and not ſtand, as upon <hi>clay</hi> or <hi>ſtone,</hi> to chill the roots and make the Corn languiſh.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Where by the way let it be noted, that I ſaid a <hi>cold ſtiff clay</hi> or <hi>cloſe free-ſtone;</hi> for if there be under a ſhallow <hi>mould,</hi> a <hi>clay</hi> that's mixed (as 'tis common in the blew ones of this <hi>County</hi>) either with <hi>pyrites aureus,</hi> or <hi>braſs lumps;</hi> or the ſtones be of the warm <hi>calcarious</hi> kind, it may nevertheleſs be <hi>fruitful</hi> in <hi>Corn,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe, I ſuppoſe, do <hi>warm</hi> the ground, and give ſo much ſtrength, that they largely recompence what was wanting in depth.</p>
               <p n="6">6. More poſſibly might have been added to this general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Earths,</hi> and not a little inſtructive to the <hi>Farmers</hi> of the <hi>Country,</hi> but I found moſt of them froward and to ſlight my <hi>Quaere's;</hi> let them therefore thank themſelves if I am not ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging: Beſide, it ſeems a buſineſs a little beſide my <hi>deſign,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:172327:40"/>
in haſt I proceed to a more particular Conſideration of <hi>Earths</hi> (as before of <hi>Waters</hi>) holding ſome <hi>Spirit, Bitumen,</hi> or <hi>concrete Juice,</hi> and as they are uſeful in <hi>Trades,</hi> or are otherwiſe neceſſary, convenient, or ornamental.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But herein I ſhall not ſhew my ſelf either ſo angry or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or ſo much either diſreſpect my ſubject, or the civilities of the <hi>Gentry</hi> for the ſake of the <hi>clowns,</hi> as not in the next place to treat of ſuch <hi>Earths</hi> whoſe moſt eminent uſes relate to <hi>Husbandry,</hi> ſince they alſo hold ſome <hi>concrete Juices</hi> (whereby they become improvements of ſuch poor barren Lands) and are therefore very ſuitable to my preſent purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The beſt of theſe we call commonly <hi>Marls,</hi> whereof, though 'twas believed there were none in <hi>Oxford-ſhire,</hi> yet I met with no leſs than three ſeveral ſorts, and in quantities ſufficient enough for uſe. The <hi>Britiſh Marls</hi> were very famous of old, whereof <hi>Pliny</hi>
                  <note n="r" place="bottom">Plin. Nat. Hiſt. lib. <hi>17.</hi> cap. <hi>6, 7.</hi>
                  </note> numbers ſeveral ſorts; and of principal note were the <hi>Leucargillae,</hi> whereby, he ſays, <hi>Britan</hi> was greatly enriched: And of this kind, <hi>that</hi> I gueſs may be one, lately diſcovered by the much <hi>Honored,</hi> and my truly noble Friend, <hi>Thomas Stonor</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of <hi>Watlington-Park,</hi> of which he already has had good expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience: of colour it is <hi>whitiſh,</hi> a little inclining to <hi>yellow,</hi> not very fat, and of ſo eaſie diſſolution, that it may be laid on the ground at any time of the year, and may be as good, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for <hi>paſture</hi> as <hi>arable:</hi> this <hi>he</hi> found at a place near <hi>Blunds-Court,</hi> but I think within the Pariſh of <hi>Shiplake,</hi> where upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other account ſinking a deep pit, amongſt other matters he met with this <hi>Marl.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Since that, there has lately been another diſcovered by that eminent <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Pennyſton,</hi> in his own Grounds in the Pariſh of <hi>Cornwell,</hi> about a quarter of a mile <hi>north-weſt</hi> of his Houſe, of a blue colour, and ſo abſterſive, that it would readily enough take ſpots out of cloaths, and gave its <hi>owner</hi> ſome ground to hope, that poſſibly it might be fit for the <hi>Fullers</hi> uſe; but he quickly, upon tryal, diſcovered an incurable fault that the Men of that Trade will never pardon: however, I take it to be ſo rich a <hi>Marl,</hi> that it may amply recompence the induſtry of its <hi>Maſter,</hi> if laid on its neighboring barren Hills; which I <hi>adviſe</hi> may be done about the beginning of Winter, that the Froſts and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:172327:41"/>
Rain may the better ſeparate its parts, and fit it to incorporate with that hungry Soil.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Which condition I ſuppoſe may not at all be required, in the manure of a light and hollow ſort of <hi>Marl,</hi> lately found by the worſhipful and induſtrious Improver, <hi>George Pudſey</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of <hi>Elsfield:</hi> for in water it diſſolves almoſt as ſoon as <hi>Fullers earth,</hi> and is naturally of it ſelf ſo hollow and ſpungy, that one would think it were always in the very ferment, and may therefore be uſed at any fit time of year: of colour when dry, it is of a whitiſh gray, intermixed with ſand, and very friable, and may in all probability be the very ſame, with the <hi>Marga candida are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſa friabilis,</hi> of <hi>Hildeſheim,</hi> mention'd by <hi>Kentmannus</hi>
                  <note n="s" place="bottom">Kentman. nomenelat. rer. foſ. cap. <hi>3.</hi> de Margis.</note>, and out of him by <hi>Lachmund.</hi> Of juſt ſuch another <hi>Marl</hi> as this, brittle and duſty when dry, but fat when wet, we are inform'd there is at <hi>Wexford</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <p n="11">11. It may therefore be expedient, that theſe new found <hi>Marls</hi> be thus agreeably tryed, and though they anſwer not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation the firſt year, as ſome ſay they will not<note n="u" place="bottom">Plin.

                  </note>, let not their <hi>Owners</hi> be thus diſcouraged, but ſtill continue to make frequent tryals, of divers proportions of Earth, at all ſeaſons of the year, with all kinds of Grain upon all ſorts of Soil, till they find out the moſt ſuitable and neceſſary circumſtances, ſo ſhall they in time attain to a knowledge beyond the expectation, and perchance imitation of their Neighbors. But I forbear to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct ſuch <hi>Ingenious Perſons,</hi> as the <hi>Owners</hi> of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Marl-pits are: the <hi>Orator</hi> being accounted little leſs than a fool, that went about in his Speech to teach <hi>Hannibal</hi> to fight.</p>
               <p n="12">12. But beſide theſe, we have another ſort of Earth, of a fat cloſe texture, and greeniſh colour, ſo well impregnated with ſome kind of <hi>ſalt,</hi> that put in the fire, it preſently <hi>decrepitates</hi> with no
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:172327:41"/>
leſs noiſe than <hi>ſalt</hi> it ſelf; and in <hi>water,</hi> after a quick and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ſolution, leaves behind it a kind of brackiſh taſt, which I thought might proceed from a ſort of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and perhaps true enough, though the water would not tinge with powder of galls: it takes greaſe out of cloaths extreamly well, and would it but whiten, as <hi>Fullers earth</hi> doth, I ſhould not doubt to pronounce it the ſame with the <hi>viridis Saponaria,</hi> found near <hi>Beichling</hi> in <hi>Thuringia,</hi> and mentioned by <hi>Kentmannus</hi> in his collection of <hi>Foſſils</hi>
                  <note n="w" place="bottom">Cap. <hi>1.</hi> De terris.</note>. This we have in great plenty in <hi>Shot-over Foreſt,</hi> where 'tis always met with before they come to the <hi>Ochre,</hi> from which it is ſeparated but by a thin <hi>Iron crust,</hi> and may peradventure be as ſtrickt a concomitant of <hi>yellow Ochre,</hi> as <hi>Chryſocolla</hi> (another green Earth) is ſaid to be of <hi>Gold.</hi> At preſent 'tis accounted of ſmall or no value, but in recompence of the ſignal favors of its preſent <hi>Proprietor,</hi> the Right Worſhipful Sir <hi>Timothy Tyrril,</hi> who in perſon was pleaſed to ſhew me the <hi>pits,</hi> I am ready to diſcover a uſe it may have, that may poſſibly equal that of his <hi>Ochre.</hi> Which brings me next to treat of ſuch <hi>Earths</hi> as are found in <hi>Oxford-ſhire,</hi> and are uſeful in Trades.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And amongſt theſe the <hi>Ochre</hi> of <hi>Shotover,</hi> no doubt, may challenge a principal place, it being accounted the beſt in its kind in the world, of a yellow colour and very weighty, much uſed by <hi>Painters</hi> ſimply of it ſelf, and as often mix'd with the reſt of their <hi>colours.</hi> This by <hi>Pliny</hi>

               <p n="32">32. The firſt whereof happened in <hi>August,</hi> about twenty years ſince, when two men of the place imployed to dig a well, firſt ſickned, and wiſely withdrew from the work: whereupon it was undertaken by two others of <hi>Woodſtock,</hi> men of greater reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and leſs wiſdom; who before they could do any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably in it, ſunk down and irrecoverably dyed in the well: which quickly being perceived by a woman above, a <hi>Miller</hi> hard

by was called to their aſſiſtance, who as unhappily as willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcending to them, alſo ſuddenly fell down upon them, and dyed: To whom, after ſome deliberation taken, <hi>another</hi> ventures down with a roap about his middle, but he fell from the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in juſt the ſame manner, and though preſently drawn up by the people above, yet was ſcarcely recover'd in an hour or more.</p>

Thus having conſidered the principal <hi>Earths</hi> uſed in <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, Painting, Medicine, &amp;c.</hi> I proceed in the next place to treat of ſome others, leſs in value, and put to inferior uſes: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which we may reckon the very uppermoſt Turf; which beſide for <hi>Bowling-greens,</hi> and <hi>Graſs-walks</hi> in Gardens, is here not unfrequently uſed by <hi>Thatchers,</hi> and laid on <hi>Mud-walls,</hi> and the <hi>tops</hi> of Houſes, in the place and manner of thoſe we call <hi>Ridge-tiles;</hi> not that it is ſo good as <hi>Thatching</hi> (though ſome ſay it better reſiſts the winds) but becauſe in ſome places Wood is ſo ſcarce, that they cannot get <hi>ſpraies</hi> to faſten on <hi>Thatch;</hi> or elſe the people ſo poor that they care not to buy them.</p>
               <p n="41">41. Alſo at ſome other places for want of <hi>Wood,</hi> they make uſe of another ſort of <hi>Turf</hi> for fewel, not the upper <hi>Green-ſword,</hi> but an inferior ſtringy <hi>bituminous Earth,</hi> cut out like <hi>Bricks,</hi> for the moſt part from mooriſh boggy grounds; in ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries called <hi>Peat-pits,</hi> in others <hi>Moſſes.</hi> The beſt of this Turf that I have ſeen in <hi>Oxford-ſhire,</hi> I met with at Mr. <hi>Warcups</hi> in the Pariſh of <hi>North-Moor,</hi> but dug as I was informed in <hi>Stanton-Harcourt,</hi> about a mile diſtance S. Weſt from the Church: it lies but one ſpits depth within the ground, and is ſuppoſed to be at leaſt four foot thick: They cut it in <hi>March,</hi> and lay the pieces called <hi>Peats</hi> to dry on the graſs, ſomtimes turning them; which when reaſonably well done, they then pile up like <hi>Wheelwrights felleys,</hi> leaving every where empty ſpaces between, that the Air and Wind paſſing through them, they at length may become dry enough for the fire. They think that the <hi>ſtringy roots,</hi> that together with the <hi>Bitumen,</hi> make up the <hi>Peats,</hi> do never flouriſh above the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face: if ſo, I am ſomthing confirmed in an opinion, that there are

many <hi>ſubterraneous Plants</hi> not noted, of which I intend a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent enquiry<note n="r" place="bottom">Vid. Nich. Stenonis Prodrom.</note>. After the <hi>Peats</hi> are taken out, they fill up the ground again with the graſſy <hi>earth</hi> that was firſt cut up. And at <hi>Cowley,</hi> where they alſo dig them, they uſually leave the depth of one <hi>ſpade-graft</hi> at the bottom, as a foundation whereon they may grow again, which in the ſpace of twenty or thirty years, 'tis obſerv'd they will do in the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>England</hi>

The ſcarcity alſo of fireing has induced ſome People to burn a ſort of <hi>black ſubſtance,</hi> of a grain ſomwhat like rotten wood half burnt, but participating alſo of a <hi>Mineral</hi> nature, and therefore by Authors called <hi>Metallophytum,</hi> or <hi>Lignum foſſile</hi>

                  </note>: put into <hi>water,</hi> it will not ſwim; and into <hi>fire,</hi> it conſumes but ſlowly, and ſends forth very unpleaſant fumes: it is found in a Quarry called <hi>Langford-pits,</hi> in the Pariſh of <hi>Kidlington,</hi> not far from <hi>Thrup,</hi> about eighteen foot deep under the Rock, where there lies a bed about four inches thick. But at <hi>Ducklington</hi> I met with a much finer kind, and richer in <hi>bitumen;</hi> for though on the out ſide it looks like wood, yet broken, it ſhews a ſmooth and ſhining <hi>ſuperficies,</hi> not unlike to <hi>ſtone-pitch,</hi> and put in the <hi>fire,</hi> has not near ſo ill a ſmell.

As for the ſubſtance, <hi>Lignum foſſile</hi> it is thought to be originally a <hi>cretaceous earth,</hi> turned to what it is by <hi>ſubterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous heats,</hi> which probably at <hi>Kidlington</hi> may indeed be great, becauſe reflected by the Quarry above it, for that it was never formerly wood, notwithſtanding its ſpecious and outward like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is plain, from its never being found with <hi>roots</hi> or <hi>boughs,</hi> or any other ſigns of wood.</p>
               <p n="43">43. At <hi>Marſh Balden</hi> Heath, and <hi>Nuneham-Courtney,</hi> they have a ſort of <hi>earth</hi> of ductile parts, which put in the fire ſcarcely cracks, and has been formerly uſed by <hi>Potters,</hi> but upon what account I know not, now neglected. There is alſo a Clay near <hi>Little Milton</hi> that might very well ſerve for the <hi>Potters</hi> uſe. And at <hi>Shotover-hill</hi> there is a <hi>white clay,</hi> the fourth fold of earth in the way to the <hi>Ochre,</hi> which during the late wars, in the ſiege of <hi>Oxford,</hi> was wholly uſed for making <hi>Tobacco-pipes</hi> there; and is

               </p>
               <p n="44">44. And ſo do's an <hi>anonymous</hi> very <hi>white earth,</hi> found in the ſeams of the Quarries at <hi>Teynton,</hi> which at firſt I concluded a <hi>crude Alabaſter,</hi> becauſe I found near it a piece that was perfect: but reducing it into a very fine powder, and putting it over a quick fire, it would not boil like <hi>Alabaster</hi> duſt, nor keep the colour, but turned reddiſh. Many other tryals were made with it, in <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, Poliſhing, Painting, &amp;c.</hi> but my endeavors ſucceeded in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo well, as in <hi>poliſhing</hi> ſmaller ſilver Veſſels, that could not endure <hi>burniſhing well;</hi> to which it gave a more glorious bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than <hi>Tripela</hi> would, though perhaps not ſo laſting; and not far behinde that of burniſh'd Plate.</p>
               <p n="45">45. And yet neither this, nor the former will poliſh <hi>braſs,</hi> nor any thing elſe that is not of its colour, which has lately engaged my thoughts in a <hi>Query,</hi> whether in all other <hi>Metals</hi> the rule does hold: for I find, that <hi>ſulphur</hi> gives a luſter to <hi>Gold;</hi> and that nothing does brighten <hi>Copper</hi> ſo well, as a ſort of ſtuff they call <hi>rotten ſtone,</hi> alſo ſomthing of its colour.</p>
               <p n="46">46. At <hi>Teynton</hi> alſo, within a ſpit of the ſurface, they dig a ſort of earth they there call <hi>Lam,</hi> of a whitiſh colour inclining to yellow; which mixt with ſand, and ſome other earth, makes the beſt <hi>earthen floors</hi> for ground-rooms and barns: it diſſolves as quick as <hi>Fullers-earth,</hi> and were it not for a fault which might poſſibly be help'd, it may ſerve their turns perhaps as well as any they uſe.</p>
               <p n="47">47. To theſe may be added another <hi>whitiſh earth,</hi> which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly I ſuppoſe from its colour is called <hi>Which-earth;</hi> mixed with ſtraw, they uſe it for ſide-walls and ceilings, and with horſe-dung it makes mortar for laying of ſtones: it ſeems to be a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral mixture of <hi>lime</hi> and <hi>ſand,</hi> found at <hi>Thame, Waterperry,</hi> and <hi>Adwell,</hi> and ſlakes in water (like <hi>Gypſum</hi>) without any heat.</p>
               <p n="48">48. At <hi>Milton</hi> near <hi>Adderbury, Great Tew,</hi> and <hi>Stunsfield,</hi> I met alſo with another ſort of ſpungy chalk, which though it will not ſlake like the former; yet at <hi>Milton</hi> and <hi>Adderbury</hi> uſed for point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſeems to binde the ſtones of their walls very well: and theirs at <hi>Great Tew</hi> being ſomwhat finer, ſerves as well to white their
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:172327:47"/>
rooms within (as I ſaw at <hi>Swerford</hi>) as to point walls without: but at <hi>Stunsfield</hi> there was no body knew of its uſe.</p>
               <p n="49">49. Other earths there are that I find in this County, for whoſe <hi>names,</hi> as well as <hi>natures,</hi> I am quite at a loſs; whereof there is one in Sir <hi>Thomas Pennyſtons</hi> Park, which for the ſtrangeneſs of its qualities deſerves the firſt place. Of colour it is extreamly white, of little taſt, and leſs ſmell; lying in veins in a yellowiſh clay, like a <hi>medulla</hi> about the bigneſs of ones wriſt: taken out with a knife, it falls into a fine powder, ſomwhat gritty, but of ſo very great a weight, that its double at leaſt to any other <hi>earth</hi> of its bulk; put in the ſcale againſt <hi>white Marble dust,</hi> it equall'd its weight, and exceeded that of <hi>Alabaſter</hi> by almoſt a fourth part: ſet in ſand in a glaſs retort, and driven with a quick and ſtrong fire, it ſublimed to the ſides of the glaſs a little, but ſtill preſerved its colour and weight, till put between two <hi>Crucibles,</hi> one invert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the other; well luted, and ſtrongly forced in a <hi>wind-furnace</hi> for about two hours, it loſt above the moiety of its weight: for as I well remember, of <hi>three ounces</hi> put in, there came not out full <hi>one</hi> and a <hi>half,</hi> and yet nothing ſublimed in the top of the <hi>Crucible:</hi> the colour ſtill remained as white as ever, and the bulk (as near as I could gueſs) the ſame, but now of a ſtrong <hi>ſalt</hi> and <hi>urinous</hi> taſt; which after ſolution, filtration, and evaporation, came at laſt, to what people as little underſtood, as what became of its <hi>ponderous</hi> ingredient.</p>
               <p n="50">50. We tryed it alſo at <hi>Cornwell,</hi> in Sir <hi>Thomas Pennyston</hi>'s <hi>Laboratory,</hi> becauſe of its weight with divers <hi>fluxing ſalts,</hi> in hopes of ſome kind of <hi>metalline</hi> ſubſtance, but all, as before, to little purpoſe. So that I cannot tell what to divine it ſhould be, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the <hi>Gur</hi> of the <hi>Adeptiſts</hi> congealed, which they deſcribe in their Books to be much ſuch a thing, which for want of more time to ſpend in its ſervice, I leave to the diſcovery of future ages.</p>
               <p n="51">51. In the Chalk-pits almoſt every where in the South-eaſt parts of <hi>Oxford-ſhire,</hi> they finde a ſort of iron-colour'd <hi>terra la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidoſa,</hi> in the very body of the <hi>chalk,</hi> which I think they call <hi>Iron-moulds,</hi> and particularly at a place between <hi>Brightwell</hi> and <hi>Berrick,</hi> of an oval figure: how they came to be of that ſhape, or at all grow, in a ſubſtance of ſo different a nature as <hi>chalk,</hi> I confeſs to be a <hi>problem</hi> beyond my knowledge, as well as the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:172327:48"/>
uſe they may probably have, which I alſo remit to poſterity to find.</p>
               <p n="52">52. They have an earth about <hi>Teynton</hi> of a yellowiſh colour, adorned all over with <hi>glittering ſparks,</hi> which unleſs they are particles of the <hi>ſpecular ſtone,</hi> or Engliſh <hi>Talc,</hi> with the former muſt be reckoned amongſt the unknown <hi>earths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="53">53. To which add another kind of <hi>terra lapidoſa</hi> found about <hi>Thame,</hi> at the bottom of their Quarries, it is much of the colour of the <hi>Turkiſh Ruſma,</hi> hollow and ſpungy, and full of ſhining grains like a ſort of <hi>Pyrites,</hi> but of what nature or uſe I can no where find. Nor of another ſort of <hi>Clay</hi> found at <hi>Hampton-Gay,</hi> holding a grit of a golden colour, much of the nature of <hi>Pyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes aureus,</hi> only 'tis not found like that in great pieces, which by our modern Naturaliſts are called <hi>Braſs lumps.</hi>

               <p>AS in the Chapters of <hi>Waters</hi> and <hi>Earths,</hi> I treated only of ſuch as eminently held ſome <hi>ſalt</hi> or <hi>ſulphur,</hi> and were ſome way or other uſeful to <hi>Man:</hi> I intend in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in this of <hi>Stones</hi> ſtrictly to obſerve the ſame <hi>method,</hi> and take notice only of ſuch as either plainly ſhew thoſe <hi>Minerals,</hi> and ſupply the <hi>neceſſities;</hi> or are for the <hi>ornament,</hi> or <hi>delight</hi> of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How all <hi>ſtones</hi> are chiefly made out of <hi>ſalts,</hi> with a mixture of <hi>earth</hi> and ſomtimes of <hi>ſulphur,</hi> was formerly hinted in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place. It remains only that I conſider them in a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manner, and ſhew which they be, and where they are, that hold any of theſe principles more ſignally than other, which I ſuppoſe by their effects may beſt be diſcover'd.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the Road from <hi>Oxford</hi> toward <hi>London,</hi> not far beyond <hi>Tetſworth,</hi> in a hollow way on the riſing of a hill, I found a ſoft ſtone there-about called <hi>Maume,</hi> of a whitiſh colour; whoſe <hi>ſalt</hi> is ſo free from the bonds of <hi>ſulphur,</hi> that with the froſts and rain it ſlakes like <hi>lime:</hi> perhaps half the firing uſed to burn away the <hi>ſulphur</hi> in other <hi>lime-ſtone,</hi> might ſerve the turn here. An Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment ſo very likely to be beneficial to the <hi>Country,</hi> that I left it with the Son of the ingenious Improver, Sir <hi>Thomas Tipping,</hi> as a thing not unworthy of his Fathers tryal; but whether he have at all, or but unſucceſsfully made any, I have not yet had the favor to hear.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the way to <hi>Whitfield,</hi> as I rod thither from <hi>Tetſworth,</hi> I found the ways mended with this kinde of <hi>ſtone,</hi> I ſuppoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they could get no other, for certainly otherwiſe there were nothing more unfit, than a ſtone of ſo looſe and open a <hi>ſalt:</hi> much rather with ſuch ſhould they mend their Lands than High-ways, that like <hi>lime, marles,</hi> and <hi>chalk,</hi> will ſlake in the Winter; which I take for ſo ſure a mark of its <hi>improving</hi> quality, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but commend it to the tryal of the <hi>Country.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. And for their encouragement, let me farther tell them, that at a place called <hi>Hornton</hi> in the North of this County, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:172327:49"/>
uſe the <hi>chippings</hi> of the <hi>stone</hi> dug there in the Quarry, for <hi>improvement</hi> of the Land, and that not without apparent ſucceſs: and yet the ſtone is of a much harder kind, than this at <hi>Tetſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> and in the way to <hi>Whitfield.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Amongſt ſome MSS. notes of <hi>Natural things,</hi> I met with one of a ſtone at <hi>Oriel College,</hi> commonly called (ſays the Author) <hi>The ſweating ſtone,</hi> at which the Birds were conſtantly pecking and licking; as I gueſs (if ever there were any ſuch thing) for ſome kind of <hi>ſaltneſs</hi> they found come from it: I ſay, if ever there were any ſuch thing, for I find it not in this <hi>new,</hi> nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains there any tradition of it in the <hi>old College.</hi> I therefore paſs it by without further notice.</p>
               <p n="7">7. However, in ſhort, all ſtones have ſo much <hi>ſalt</hi> in them, that in ſome meaſure they are an <hi>improvement</hi> of Land, for though it be ſo cloſe lock'd up with <hi>ſulphur,</hi> that the greateſt froſts and rain will not make the ſtones run, yet there is ſtill ſuch an emiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>ſaline</hi> ſteams, that ſome <hi>earths</hi> have their whole fertility from them. Thus have I ſeen Fields cover'd with Flints and Pebbles, produce better Corn than where there were none, which perhaps may be a better reaſon than what is brought by <hi>Pliny</hi>

               <p n="8">8, The like may be obſerved in <hi>walls and buildings,</hi> where ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts of <hi>vegetables,</hi> yea <hi>trees</hi> of great bigneſs, will thrive and proſper remote from the <hi>earth,</hi> without any further nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than that they have from the <hi>fertile ſtones,</hi> and <hi>lime</hi> they are laid with, alſo made out of <hi>stones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. If it be objected that <hi>Pebbles</hi> and <hi>Flints</hi> alſo hold a <hi>ſulphur,</hi> as well as a <hi>ſalt,</hi> and that in all probability Corn and other Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables may receive their flouriſhing verdure, rather from the warm comfortable ſteams of that, then the others of <hi>ſalt,</hi> I ſhall not ſo much as contend about it, but gladly accept of the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity by this means to paſs from <hi>ſtones</hi> holding <hi>ſalt</hi> only, to ſuch as have alſo a mixture of <hi>ſulphur.</hi>

                  <hi>Finstock</hi> and <hi>Nuneham-Courtney;</hi> I found them alſo in the way between <hi>New-yate</hi> and <hi>Enſham,</hi> but none comparable to what was ſhewn me by that great <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> the Right Worſhipful Sir <hi>Anthony Cope</hi> of <hi>Hanwell,</hi> the moſt eminent <hi>Artiſt</hi> and <hi>Naturalist</hi> while he lived, if not of <hi>England,</hi> moſt certainly of this <hi>County,</hi> whoſe Houſe me thought ſeemed to be the real <hi>New Atlantis,</hi> which my Lord <hi>Viſcount Verulam</hi> had only in fanſie.

               <p n="19">19. After conſideration of <hi>Flints</hi> and <hi>Pebbles</hi> apart, let us now take a view of them jointly together, for ſo I found them at <hi>Caverſham,</hi> and <hi>Greenvil,</hi> and in the way from <hi>Puſhill</hi> to <hi>Stonor-houſe,</hi> in cluſters together of divers colours, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into one body, by a <hi>petrified</hi> cement as hard as themſelves, and moſt of them I believe capable of <hi>politure</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">There is a Quarry of this South of <hi>Wolvercot</hi> Church, but the Cement ſo ſoft, that it will not polish.</note>. But the beſt of all are in the Cloſe at <hi>Stonor,</hi> of which there are ſome ſo large and cloſe knit, that could the Ingenious Proprietor, <hi>Thomas Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> find a way to ſlit and poliſh them without too much charge, he might make him rich <hi>Chimney-pieces</hi> and <hi>Tables</hi> of them, ſo far excelling <hi>Porphyrie</hi> and <hi>Marble,</hi> that perhaps they might compare with the beſt <hi>Jaſper</hi> or <hi>Achat.</hi> For I have ſeen ſuch as theſe found about <hi>Hampſted,</hi> curiouſly wrought into handles of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:172327:51"/>
knives by that eminent Artiſt Sir <hi>Anthony Cope;</hi> to which few <hi>Achats</hi> might be compared, perchance none preferr'd, either in the poliſh or variety of colours.</p>
               <p n="20">20. The Ingenious Mr. <hi>Ray,</hi> amongſt other Obſervations made in his Journey through <hi>Italy, &amp;c.</hi> tells us, That in the Church of the <hi>Benedictines</hi> at <hi>Ravenna,</hi> the <hi>Monks</hi> did ſhew him two <hi>Marble pillars,</hi> for which they ſaid, the <hi>Venetians</hi> offer'd them no leſs than their utmoſt weight in Silver. But the like he ſays, he had ſeen elſewhere, at the Library at <hi>Zurich,</hi> and at <hi>Verona</hi> in our <hi>Ladies Chappel,</hi> in the Garden of <hi>Seignior Horatio Guiſti:</hi> their generation at firſt, ſays he, was out of a maſs of ſmall Flints and Pebbles, united by a <hi>cement</hi> as hard as themſelves, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>politure;</hi> which <hi>cement,</hi> he gueſſes, was ſeparated by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees from a <hi>fluid</hi> wherein the ſtones formerly lay: which I take to be a deſcription ſo agreeable to ours, that nothing more need be ſaid to promote their tryal.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Hither alſo muſt be reduced a courſer ſort of <hi>Smiris,</hi> dug up in the pits at <hi>Whately</hi> Towns end, of a cinereous colour, hard and rough, and ſtriking fire as well as a Flint. The beſt ſort of <hi>Smiris</hi> ſerves for ſeveral uſes; but ours is fit only to cut the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſort of ſtones, that the ſand commonly uſed will not ſo well do, and perhaps for ſome other inferior uſes.</p>
               <p n="22">22. And to theſe muſt be added the ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Sands,</hi> which upon violent motions all ſtrike fire, and are commonly, and ſomtimes promiſcuouſly uſed, for <hi>Building, Hour-glaſſes,</hi> and <hi>cutting</hi> of Stone. But ſome there are of a more peculiar and conſiderable uſe, and ſuch is that dug in the Pariſh of <hi>Kingham,</hi> which after 'tis waſhed and duly ordered, ſo perfectly reſembles <hi>Calis-ſand,</hi> that it ſerves and is ſold for the very ſame: it is not found in every place, but they have ſigns (like <hi>Miners</hi>) to know where it lies; <hi>viz.</hi> a ſort of ſtuff that looks almoſt like <hi>rotten wood,</hi> which if they meet with under the Turf, they ſeldom fail of the Sand a little deeper; which they firſt cleanſe from rubbiſh, and the greater ſtones, by putting it through a courſe ſieve, then they waſh it in a trough and lay it a drying; which when ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently done, they ſeparate again by a finer ſieve, the courſer part of it from the finer: the courſer ſerves for wheting of <hi>ſithes,</hi> but the finer ſort for ſcouring <hi>pewter,</hi> for which purpoſe it ſeems 'tis ſo very excellent, that the Retailers ſell it for a penny a
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:172327:51"/>
pound, which amounts to above twenty ſhillings a buſhel.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Other <hi>ſands</hi> there are alſo of very good uſe, to give a conſiſtency and body to <hi>glaſs;</hi> the naturally whiteſt are at <hi>Nettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed</hi> and <hi>Shot-over,</hi> but the fineſt by much at <hi>Finſtock</hi> and <hi>Ledwell,</hi> which when waſhed and cleanſed, at leaſt equal the former. The firſt of theſe has been tryed with ſucceſs at the Glaſs-houſe at <hi>Henly:</hi> and any of the reſt, perhaps, might prove as good <hi>Tarſo</hi> as any they have from <hi>France,</hi> or is uſed in <hi>Italy,</hi> were they but in place where they might be tryed.</p>
               <p n="24">24. From <hi>Sands,</hi> I proceed to <hi>Lapis arenarius,</hi> commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Free-ſtone,</hi> and uſed in Building; of which we have as great plenty and variety in <hi>Oxford-ſhire,</hi> peradventure as in any other part of <hi>England.</hi> The Quarry at <hi>Heddington,</hi> ſcarce two miles from <hi>Oxford,</hi> ſupplies us continually with a good ſort of <hi>ſtone,</hi> and fit for all uſes but that of <hi>fire;</hi> in which, that of <hi>Teynton</hi> and <hi>Hornton</hi> excel it. In the Quarry it cuts very ſoft and eaſie, and is worked accordingly for all ſorts of Building; very porous, and fit to imbibe lime and ſand, but hardening continually as it lies to the <hi>weather.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="25">25. Of it in general, there are two ſorts; one that they call <hi>Free-stone,</hi> and the other <hi>Rag-ſtone:</hi> but theſe again are ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into ſeveral <hi>ſpecies,</hi> according as they are cut or put to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers uſes. The <hi>Free-ſtone,</hi> if cut <hi>cubically</hi> into very great blocks, is then by way of eminence called nothing but <hi>Free-ſtone;</hi> but if cut into <hi>oblong,</hi> or other ſorts of <hi>ſquares,</hi> of a leſſer bulk, they then call it <hi>Aſhler;</hi> and the fragments of theſe of inequilateral, multangular Figures, <hi>Scabble-burs.</hi> The two firſt are uſed in principal Buildings, and the laſt, if ſquared, is ſomtimes mixed with <hi>Aſhler</hi> in <hi>Range-work,</hi> or by it ſelf in that they call <hi>Planten-work</hi> in the meaner Buildings: but when not ſquared at all, is commonly thrown in amongſt <hi>Rag-ſtone</hi> for walling; for which only, and making <hi>lime,</hi> that ſecond ſort is good, except it riſes flat in the bed, and then 'tis worth the while to hew it for paving.</p>
               <p n="26">26. Of the <hi>ſtone</hi> afore-mentioned conſiſts the groſs of our Buildings; but for <hi>Columns, Capitels, Baſes, Window-lights, Door-caſes, Corniſhing, Mouldings, &amp;c.</hi> in the chiefeſt work they uſe <hi>Burford-ſtone,</hi> which is whiter and harder, and carries by much a finer <hi>Arris,</hi> than that at <hi>Heddington:</hi> but yet is not ſo hard as
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:172327:52"/>
that at <hi>Teynton,</hi> nor will it like that endure the fire, of which they make <hi>Mault-kills,</hi> and <hi>hearths</hi> for <hi>Ovens;</hi> but then they take care to <hi>ſurbed</hi> the ſtone, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſet it edg-ways, contrary to the poſture it had in the bed, for otherwiſe there will be ſome danger of its flying.</p>
               <p n="27">27. Beſide the fire, it endures the weather, for of this mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with another ſort dug near <hi>Whately,</hi> on the <hi>Worceſter</hi> road ſide, as it paſſes betwixt <hi>Holton</hi> and Sir <hi>Timothy Tyrrills,</hi> are all the oldeſt <hi>Colleges</hi> in <hi>Oxford</hi> built; as <hi>Baliol, Merton, Exeter, Queens, Canterbury</hi> (now part of <hi>Ch. Ch.) College, Durham</hi> (now <hi>Trinity) College, New College, Lincoln, All Souls, Magdalen, Braſen-noſe,</hi> and the outermoſt Quadrangle of <hi>St. John Bapt. Coll.</hi> yet it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures not the <hi>weather</hi> ſo well as <hi>Heddington,</hi> by reaſon, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, of a ſalt it has in it, which the weather in time plainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves, as may be ſeen by the Pinnacles of <hi>New College</hi> Chappel, made of this ſtone, and thus melted away.</p>
               <p n="28">28. And yet the moiſture of water has no ſuch power over it, but that they make of it <hi>Troughs</hi> and <hi>Ciſterns,</hi> and now of late <hi>Meſh-fats</hi> for <hi>Brewing;</hi> firſt hinted, 'tis true, by Mr. <hi>Bayly</hi> of <hi>Ducklington,</hi> but practiſed by one Mr. <hi>Veyſey</hi> of <hi>Teynton,</hi> who had the firſt made him by one <hi>Strong</hi> a Maſon, which it ſeems did an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer expectation ſo well, that it has ſince obtained in many other places. Of theſe, that generous and courteous Gentleman, Sir <hi>Compton Read</hi> of <hi>Shipton</hi> under <hi>Whichwood,</hi> has one that holds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſixty five buſhels, drawn home with no leſs than one and twenty horſes; they ordinarily <hi>meſh</hi> in it three quarters of Mault, but can, when at any time neceſſity requires, <hi>meſh</hi> five at a time: the dimenſions of which Veſſel of one ſingle ſtone, taken within the hollow and abating its thickneſs, becauſe of its vaſt unuſual magnitude, I thought fit to note, and give as followeth;
<list>
                     <item>long, 2 yards ⅛.</item>
                     <item>broad, 1 yard ⅛. and ½ an inch.</item>
                     <item>deep, 1 yard ½.</item>
                  </list>
yet much larger than this might be had from the Quarry, were there uſe for them, or could portage be contrived; for as I was informed by many credible witneſſes, there was one ſingle ſtone dug in this Quarry, containing no leſs than <hi>three hundred tuns.</hi> And another in the year 1673. meaſured by Mr. <hi>Veyſey,</hi> of an
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:172327:52"/>
                  <hi>hundred and three tuns,</hi> accounting ſixteen foot cubic to the <hi>tun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="29">29. Other Quarries there are alſo of conſiderable uſe, as <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, Little Milton, Barford,</hi> and <hi>Hornton,</hi> whereof the laſt has the beſt Fire-ſtone of any in the <hi>County;</hi> ſome of it ſeems to have Iron-colour'd veins, that receive (as I have ſeen) a toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able poliſh, and is the <hi>stone</hi> I mention'd before, whoſe <hi>chippings</hi> (laid on it) improve their land, by reaſon I ſuppoſe of the <hi>ſalt</hi> there is in it, which may alſo be the cauſe it endures <hi>fire</hi> ſo well.</p>
               <p n="30">30. At <hi>Cornbury Park</hi> there was a ſort of <hi>ſtone,</hi> the Quarry whereof is now quite exhauſted, that never would ſweat in the moiſteſt <hi>weather,</hi> of which the pavement of the <hi>Hall</hi> in the houſe there, ſtill remains as a ſufficient teſtimony: of this, did it riſe in great blocks, might poſſibly have been made very good <hi>Mill-ſtones,</hi> the not ſweating being a principal qualification in all <hi>stones</hi> whatever uſed for <hi>Corn-mills.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="31">31. But before we take leave of materials for Building, we muſt not forget that the Houſes are covered, for the moſt part in <hi>Oxford-ſhire</hi> (not with tiles) but <hi>ſlat-ſtone,</hi> whereof the lighteſt, and that which imbibes the water leaſt, is accounted the beſt. And ſuch is that which they have at <hi>Stunsfield,</hi> where it is dug firſt in thick cakes, about <hi>Michaelmaſs</hi> time, or before, to lye all the <hi>winter</hi> and receive the froſts, which make it cleave in the <hi>ſpring</hi> following into thinner <hi>plates,</hi> which otherwiſe it would not do ſo kindly. But at <hi>Bradwell</hi> (near the Grove) they dig a ſort of <hi>ſlat-ſtone,</hi> naturally ſuch, without the help of <hi>winter,</hi> and ſo ſtrangely great, that ſomtimes they have them of ſeven foot long, and five foot over: with theſe they commonly make mounds for their Cloſes, and I have ſeen a ſmall <hi>hovel,</hi> that for its whole co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering has required no more than one of theſe <hi>stones:</hi> and ſome of them are of ſo hard and cloſe a <hi>texture,</hi> that I have known them by <hi>Painters</hi> of very good ſkill, preferr'd before <hi>Marble</hi> for grinding their <hi>colours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="32">32. To <hi>ſtone</hi> uſed in Building they ſomtimes add <hi>Lime,</hi> which becauſe for the moſt part, is here made of <hi>ſtone,</hi> muſt alſo be handled in this place; for which they count the hardeſt <hi>rag-ſtone</hi> beſt, but any will make it, ſays the Learned <hi>Willis</hi>

Beſide the ſtone that is uſed for the <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> there is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſerves for the <hi>ornament</hi> of Building, a ſort of <hi>gray Marble</hi> dug in the Pariſh of <hi>Blechington,</hi> in the Lordſhip of the Right Honorable <hi>Arthur</hi> Earl of <hi>Angleſey,</hi> Lord <hi>Privy Seal:</hi> Of this there are ſeveral <hi>Chimny-pieces</hi> and <hi>Pavements,</hi> in his <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips</hi> Houſe there, well worth the notice; as alſo at the Right Honorable the Earl of <hi>Clarendon</hi>'s at <hi>Cornbury.</hi> And of this are the Pillars of the <hi>Portico</hi>'s at St. <hi>Johns College</hi> in <hi>Oxford.</hi> They make beſide of it <hi>Tomb-stones</hi> and <hi>Tables,</hi> and of late alſo <hi>Mill-ſtones,</hi> good enough for the <hi>Oyl-mills;</hi> but not for the <hi>Corn-mills,</hi> becauſe of its ſuppoſed ſweating, to which this is ſubject in rainy weather, like all other <hi>Marbles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="34">34. Some other <hi>ſtones</hi> there are of inferior uſe, which yet muſt by no means be paſt by in ſilence; whereof I know one ſo like the <hi>Tripoli-ſtone,</hi> in colour, conſiſtence, and for all its uſes, that I cannot but think it of the very ſame kind: to <hi>ſilver</hi> it gave that very laſting brightneſs, that another piece of Plate that was try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt it, receiv'd from the Gold-ſmiths <hi>Tripoli-ſtone,</hi> and proved it ſelf in all reſpects ſo much the very ſame; that would any thing pleaſe us not far fetch'd, perhaps there might be no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther need of ſending any more to <hi>Africa</hi> for it.</p>

               <p n="8">8. There is, 'tis true, a ſort of them of a different figure, not ſo eaſily to be met with, with only two depreſſed ſides, and ſcarce any <hi>angles,</hi> but what are ſo <hi>obtuſe</hi> that they deſerve not the name, in the whole almoſt of an <hi>Oval form,</hi> as repreſented <hi>Tab.</hi> 2. <hi>Fig.</hi> 1. <hi>b.</hi> This ſort of <hi>Selenites,</hi> beſides the ſhape, is alſo ſo different from the former in texture, that it ſlits not like that into plates or ſcales, parallel to the moſt depreſſed ſides, but quite contrary parallel to the thickneſs only; which I take to be a <hi>character</hi> abundantly ſufficient, to make it of a different <hi>ſpecies</hi> from the other, though in the reſt of their texture they be much the ſame.</p>

But I cannot ſee how our bed of clay at <hi>Heddington,</hi> above the Quarry at ſome places ten foot thick, could have been a <hi>fluid</hi> within ſome ages paſt; and yet of the <hi>Selenites</hi>'s of the <hi>Rhomboideal</hi> Figure, I find ſome as ſmall as a Barley-corn, ſome about three inches, and others again at leaſt half a foot long: ſo that they ſeem rather to have ſome ſucceſſion of growth, and now to be in <hi>fieri;</hi> than to have been all together already hardened, when the clay that now contains them was but a <hi>fluid.</hi> Beſide, they then would have been found cloſe together, whereas we here meet them ſome higher ſome lower, and mix'd all together little and great; and the very clay it ſelf, as 'tis broken to pieces, ſeeming ſomwhat inclinable to this ſort of form.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="102">102.

                  </note>, that we will eaſily believe that along the ſhoars of moſt Countries, ſuch as are particularly the ſhoars of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>Mediterranean Seas,</hi> there may all manner of <hi>Sea-ſhells</hi> be found promiſcuouſly included in Rocks or Earth, and at good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances from the Sea, where the grounds are no higher than the <hi>Volaterran hillock,</hi> which meeting with ſuitable <hi>petrifying juices,</hi> may either be wholly <hi>petrified,</hi> or where the juices are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, be only <hi>metamorphoſ'd</hi> in part, ſome of the <hi>ſhelly</hi> ſubſtance ſtill remaining; or not changed at all, as in the inſtances of <hi>Steno,</hi> and perhaps of Mr. <hi>Hook,</hi> for he tells us not where he found thoſe <hi>ſemipetrified stones.</hi>

                  </note>, yet this by no means would conclude that all others of the <hi>form</hi> muſt needs be ſo, that are attended with much different, and indeed (in reſpect of having once been <hi>ſhells</hi>) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explicable circumſtances.</p>
               <p n="120">120. Thirdly and laſtly, <hi>That it ſeems quite contrary to the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi> prudence <hi>of</hi> Nature, <hi>which is obſervable in all its works and productions, to deſign every</hi> thing <hi>to a determinate</hi> end, <hi>and for the attaining that</hi> end, <hi>makes uſe of ſuch ways as are (as far as the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

               <p n="121">121. To which I anſwer, that Nature herein acts neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to her own <hi>prudence, human ratiocination,</hi> or in <hi>vain,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wiſdom and goodneſs of the <hi>Supreme Nature,</hi> by the <hi>School-men</hi> called <hi>Naturans,</hi> that governs and directs the <hi>Natura naturata</hi> here below, to beautifie the World with theſe varieties; which I take to be the end of ſuch productions as well as of moſt <hi>Flowers,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Tulips, Anemones, &amp;c.</hi> of which we know as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle uſe as of <hi>formed stones.</hi> Nay, perhaps there may proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, number for number, be as many of <hi>them</hi> of <hi>Medicinal</hi> or other <hi>uſe,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Selenites, Belemnites, Conchites, Lapis Judaicus, &amp;c.</hi> as there are of <hi>Plants:</hi> So that unleſs we may ſay alſo (which I gueſs no body will) that theſe are produced contrary to the great wiſdom of Nature, we muſt not of <hi>ſtones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="122">122. And thus I have given the grounds of my preſent <hi>opinion,</hi> which has not been taken up out of <hi>humor</hi> or <hi>contradiction,</hi> with intent only to affront other worthy Authors modeſt conjectures, but rather friendly to <hi>excite them,</hi> or any <hi>others,</hi> to endeavor col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections of <hi>ſhell-fiſh,</hi> and parts of other <hi>Animals,</hi> that may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſuch <hi>formed stones</hi> as are here already, or may hereafter be produced: Which when ever I find done, and the <hi>reaſons</hi> alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>ſolidly</hi> anſwered, I ſhall be ready with acknowledgment to retract my <hi>opinion,</hi> which I am not ſo in love with, but for the ſake of <hi>Truth</hi> I can chearfully caſt off without the leaſt relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy.</p>
               <p n="123">123.

               </p>
               <p n="40">40.

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:172327:101"/>
opinion, that it is originally a foreigner of ſome of the <hi>ſouthern</hi> Countries, and ſo hardy a Plant, that it ſtill keeps its time of bloſſoming (which in its own <hi>Country</hi> might be about the end of <hi>December</hi>) though removed hither into a much colder <hi>Climat.</hi> Whether of theſe is moſt probable, I ſhall not determin, but leave every <hi>Reader</hi> beſt to pleaſe himſelf; and whatever more can be ſaid of it, I ſhall reſerve till I come into <hi>Somerſet-ſhire,</hi> where it is in greateſt reputation, and has been moſt obſerved.</p>

               <p n="42">42.

at <hi>Binfield</hi> and <hi>Blunds Court?</hi> and at the latter how joyned in ſo ſtrange a mixture, as <hi>Haſel-nuts,</hi> a <hi>Stags head,</hi> and <hi>

               <p n="56">56. Firſt then, as for the <hi>timber</hi> dug at <hi>Binfield</hi>-heath, 'tis likely that might be fell'd and buryed there when <hi>Societies</hi> of <hi>men</hi> (which I gueſs was not common till the days of King <hi>Alfred</hi>) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome <hi>Mean,</hi> or <hi>Lord Paramount,</hi> firſt choſe to themſelves cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain places of aboad, and promoted <hi>Agriculture:</hi> which that they might the better do they fell'd and buryed the <hi>timber</hi> which they could not well burn with the <hi>under-wood.</hi> Thus, as I have been informed by a very worthy Perſon, who had it from his aged <hi>Father,</hi> did our <hi>Grand-fathers</hi> ſerve their <hi>timber</hi> in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land parts of <hi>Kent</hi> to make room for <hi>tillage,</hi> digging a trench by each <hi>tree</hi> after it was fell'd, and ſo tumbling it in, its ſale not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worth the portage, even there, ſo few years ago.

Beſide the <hi>Elms</hi> at St. <hi>Johns</hi> knit together at the <hi>root,</hi> there are two <hi>Beeches</hi> in the way from <hi>Oxford</hi> to <hi>Reading,</hi> near a place called <hi>Cain-end,</hi> more ſtrangely joined together a great height from the ground: for the bodies of theſe <hi>Trees</hi> come from diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent roots, and aſcend parallel to the top, but are joined together a little before they come to bough, by a tranſverſe piece of tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber entering at each end into the bodies of the <hi>Trees,</hi> and growing jointly with them, for which reaſon 'tis commonly called the <hi>Gallow-tree,</hi> though the piece that intercedes them lies ſomwhat obliquely: How this ſhould come to paſs many have wondered, but the problem I gueſs may be eaſily ſolved, only by allowing the tranſverſe piece of Timber to be one of the boughs of the <hi>Tree</hi> to which its lowermoſt end ſtill joins, which whilſt young and tender, might bear ſo hard againſt the body of the neighboring <hi>Tree,</hi> that with the continual motion of the wind, it might not only fret it ſelf aſunder, but gall off the <hi>bark</hi> too of the other <hi>Tree;</hi> which cloſing up again in calm weather at the riſing of the <hi>ſap,</hi> might well include ſo near a neighbor, firſt within its <hi>bark,</hi> and after ſome time within the <hi>wood</hi> it ſelf: which I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to have been done but very lately in <hi>New College</hi> Gardens, where the boughs of two different <hi>Sycomores</hi> are thus grown to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, only by bearing hard on one another, and interchangably fretting away each others <hi>bark,</hi> and then cloſing up again at the riſing of the <hi>ſap.</hi>

From this neceſſary, and therefore I hope pardonable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, I proceed to ſome <hi>Fruit-trees</hi> not ordinary elſewhere, ſuch as the <hi>double-bearing</hi> Pear-trees: whereof I met with <hi>one</hi> in the Pariſh of <hi>Haſeley,</hi> at a place called <hi>Latchford,</hi> in the Hort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard of Mr. <hi>Gooding,</hi> called the Pear of <hi>Paradice,</hi> whoſe firſt Crop is ripe about <hi>Midſummer,</hi> and the ſecond at <hi>Michaelmaſs.</hi> There is alſo another of theſe, but of a different kind, in the Pariſh of <hi>Stanlake</hi> at the <hi>Chequer-Inn,</hi> called the <hi>Hundred-pound</hi> Pear, which Bloſſoms at two diſtinct times, and bears two Crops, whereof it has both ſorts (much like the Fig) upon the Tree at a time, ſome ripe, and others green. But in both theſe <hi>trees,</hi> the Pears in the ſecond Crops are ſomwhat leſs than of the firſt, and grow both after a peculiar manner, moſt of them, if not all, coming forth at the ends of the twigs, which are all the pedicles they ſeem to have; and therefore on the <hi>tree</hi> they do not hang downwards, like thoſe of the firſt Crop, but point up in the <hi>air,</hi> or any other way the ſhoots direct them.</p>
               <p n="87">87.

And ſuch are the <hi>blebs</hi> or <hi>blisters</hi> we find on the leaves of many <hi>Trees</hi> and <hi>Shrubs,</hi> which ſomtimes happen to them after heat and droughts, and ſomtimes too upon cold nipping weather: but whether thus infected from the <hi>air</hi> from without, or by <hi>juices</hi> within, or by <hi>both;</hi> and when by one, or the other, or both together? is a <hi>Queſtion</hi> requires a great deal of time, and more ſedulity than has yet been afforded, to be but probably ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p n="89">89. And this I the rather deſign, becauſe all that I find certain concerning them yet, is only that the weak, and free growing ſappy <hi>Trees</hi> are moſt ſubject to them, and the ſtout <hi>Ever-greens</hi> but little, if at all: that the <hi>infection</hi> for the moſt part is under, and the <hi>blister</hi> above the leaf, but ſomtimes otherwiſe: that the <hi>bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> ſomtimes have <hi>Inſects</hi> in them, ſomtimes bear <hi>fungus</hi>'s on their tops<note n="l" place="bottom">See Mr. <hi>Hooks</hi> Micrograph.

beſide <hi>Swallows,</hi> and ſome well known winter Fowl: The <hi>Cormorant</hi> has been obſerved to come hither about <hi>Harveſt</hi> time, whereof there was one killed from St. <hi>Maries</hi> ſteeple (ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with along flight) <hi>An.</hi> 1675. and another young one taken up in <hi>Arncot-field</hi> fallen down in the Corn, and brought me to <hi>Oxford.</hi>

In the proſecution whereof, it hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved (as before in the <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> §. 38.) that <hi>whiteneſs</hi> often proceeds from a defect of moiſture or nouriſhment; and it hath been a received opinion concerning <hi>Birds,</hi> that they may become <hi>white</hi> by plucking off their firſt feathers, which will cauſe their new ones to come forth of <hi>that</hi> colour. But beſide theſe ways of <hi>art</hi> and <hi>privation,</hi> it is manifeſt that <hi>Nature</hi> her ſelf ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times poſitively deſigns ſuch a colour, even in <hi>ſpecies</hi> too that ſeldom are of it, many other <hi>Animals</hi> as well as <hi>Birds,</hi> having been produced of <hi>that</hi> colour unuſual to the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> as brisk and well liking as any others whatever, ſuch as <hi>white Moles, Rats, Mice,</hi> and ſomtimes <hi>white Fawns,</hi> where there has been neither <hi>Buck</hi> nor <hi>Doe</hi> of that colour in the Park.</p>
               <p n="14">14. And this I gueſs ſhe does by giving ſome certain <hi>Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals</hi> of each <hi>ſpecies</hi> a ſkin of finer and more contracted <hi>pores</hi> than others, which will cauſe <hi>whiteneſs</hi> in feathers, hair, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by not permitting of the <hi>ſulphureous particles</hi> to expire, which give <hi>varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of colours<note n="q" place="bottom">Vid.

The firſt <hi>knocking</hi> that was heard, or at leaſt obſerved, was about a year after the reſtoration of the <hi>King,</hi> in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon a little before night, at or upon the <hi>door</hi> it being then open, as it was apprehended by Mrs. <hi>Elenor Wood,</hi> mother to Captain <hi>Baſil Wood,</hi> who only heard it, none being then by or about the <hi>houſe</hi> but her ſelf; at which ſhe was very much diſturbed, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it boded ſome ill to <hi>her</hi> or <hi>hers,</hi> and within fourteen nights after, ſhe had news of the death of her Son in law Mr. <hi>George Smith,</hi> who dyed in <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="35">35. About three years after that, there were three great <hi>knocks</hi> given very audibly to all that were then in the <hi>houſe, viz.</hi> to the aforeſaid Mrs. <hi>Elenor Wood,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baſil Wood,</hi> and his wife Mrs. <hi>Heſter,</hi> and ſome <hi>ſervants:</hi> which <hi>knocks</hi> were ſo remarkable, that one of the <hi>maids</hi> came from the <hi>well</hi> which was about twenty yards from the place, to ſee what was the matter; and Mrs. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenor Wood,</hi> and another maid that was within the <hi>houſe,</hi> ſaw three great pans of <hi>Lard</hi> ſhake and totter ſo upon a ſhelf in the <hi>Milk-houſe,</hi> that they were like to fall down. Upon this violent <hi>knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baſil Wood</hi> and his <hi>wife</hi> being then in the <hi>hall,</hi> came preſently into the <hi>milk-houſe</hi> to their mother, where finding her ſomwhat diſturbed, and enquiring the reaſon, <hi>ſhe</hi> replyed, <hi>God Almighty</hi> only knew the matter, <hi>ſhe</hi> could tell nothing but <hi>ſhe</hi> heard the <hi>knocking;</hi> which being within doors, Mr. <hi>Baſil Wood</hi> concluded muſt be for ſome of the Family at <hi>home,</hi> that upon the <hi>door</hi> being for a friend <hi>abroad:</hi> which accordingly fell out, <hi>three</hi> of the <hi>family,</hi> according to the number of the <hi>knocks,</hi> dying within little more than half a year after; <hi>viz.</hi> Mrs. <hi>Hester Wood</hi> wife to Mr. <hi>Baſil Wood,</hi> a child of Mr. <hi>Woods</hi> ſiſter, and Mrs. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenor Wood</hi> his <hi>mother.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="36">36. About <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1674. Mr. <hi>Baſil Wood junior,</hi> ſon of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil</hi> aforeſaid, living at <hi>Exeter</hi> in <hi>Devon-ſhire,</hi> heard the ſame kind of <hi>knocking,</hi> at which being diſturbed, he wrote word of it to his <hi>Father</hi> here at <hi>Bampton</hi> in <hi>Oxford-ſhire; viz.</hi> That <hi>one</hi> Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, <hi>he</hi> and his <hi>wife,</hi> and her <hi>ſister,</hi> and his <hi>brother,</hi> did diſtinctly hear upon a <hi>Table</hi> in their Chamber as they ſtood by it, two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

               <p n="37">37. Amongſt ſuch unaccountable things as theſe, we may reckon the ſtrange paſſages that happened at <hi>Woodſtock</hi> in <hi>Anno</hi> 1649. in the <hi>Manor</hi>-houſe there, when the <hi>Commiſsioners</hi> for ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying the <hi>Manor-houſe, Park, Deer, Woods,</hi> and other the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſnes</hi> belonging to that <hi>Manor,</hi> ſat and lodged there: whereof having ſeveral <hi>relations</hi> put into my hands, and one of them written by a learned and faithful <hi>perſon</hi> then living upon the place, which being confirmed to me by ſeveral <hi>eye-witneſſes</hi> of many of the particulars, and all of them by one of the <hi>Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners</hi> themſelves, who ingeniouſly confeſt to me, that he could not deny but what was written by that <hi>perſon</hi> above-mention'd was all true; I was prevailed on at laſt to make the <hi>relation</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick (though I muſt confeſs I have no eſteem for ſuch kind of <hi>ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> many of them no queſtion being performed by combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) which I have taken care to do as fully, yet as briefly as may be.</p>
               <p n="38">38. <hi>October</hi> the 13. 1649. the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> with their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants being come to the <hi>Manor-houſe,</hi> they took up their Lodging in the <hi>Kings</hi> own rooms, the <hi>Bed-chamber</hi> and <hi>with-drawing Room;</hi> the former whereof they alſo made their <hi>Kitchin;</hi> the <hi>Council-hall,</hi> their <hi>brew-houſe;</hi> the <hi>Chamber</hi> of <hi>Preſence,</hi> their place of ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to diſpatch buſineſs; and a <hi>wood-houſe</hi> of the <hi>Dining-room,</hi> where they laid the <hi>wood</hi> of that ancient <hi>Standard</hi> in the <hi>high-Park,</hi> known of all by the name of the <hi>Kings Oak,</hi> which (that nothing might remain that had the name of <hi>King</hi> affixed to it) they digged up by the <hi>roots. October</hi> the 14 and 15 they had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſturbance, but on the 16 there came as they thought, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what into the <hi>Bed-chamber</hi> where two of the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> and their <hi>ſervants</hi> lay, in the ſhape of a <hi>dog,</hi> which going under their <hi>beds,</hi> did as it were gnaw the bed-cords; but on the morrow
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:172327:126"/>
finding them whole, and a quarter of Beef which lay on the ground untouched, they began to entertain other thoughts.</p>
               <p n="39">39. <hi>Octob.</hi> 17. Somthing to their thinking removed all the <hi>wood</hi> of the <hi>Kings Oak</hi> out of the <hi>dining-room</hi> into the <hi>Preſence Chamber,</hi> and hurled the chairs and ſtools up and down that <hi>room:</hi> From whence it came into the two <hi>Chambers</hi> where the <hi>Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> and their <hi>ſervants</hi> lay, and hoiſted up their <hi>beds feet</hi> ſo much higher than the <hi>heads,</hi> that they thought they ſhould have been turned over and over, and then let them fall down with ſuch a force, that their <hi>bodies</hi> rebounded from the bed a good diſtance, and then ſhook the <hi>bed-ſteds</hi> ſo violently, that <hi>themſelves</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt their <hi>bodies</hi> were ſore with it. <hi>October</hi> 18. Somthing came into the <hi>Bed-chamber</hi> and walkt up and down, and fetching the <hi>warming-pan</hi> out of the <hi>with-drawing room,</hi> made ſo much noiſe that they thought five <hi>bells</hi> could not have made more. And <hi>October</hi> 19. <hi>Trenchers</hi> were thrown up and down the <hi>dining-room</hi> and at them that lodg'd there, whereof one of them being ſhaken by the ſhoulder and awakened, put forth his head to ſee what was the matter, but had <hi>trenchers</hi> thrown at it. <hi>October</hi> 20. the <hi>curtains</hi> of the <hi>bed</hi> in the <hi>with-drawing room</hi> were drawn to and fro, and the <hi>bedſted</hi> much ſhaken, and eight great <hi>pewter diſhes,</hi> and three dozen of <hi>trenchers,</hi> thrown about the <hi>bed-chamber</hi> again, whereof ſome fell upon the <hi>beds:</hi> this night they alſo thought whole arm-fulls of the <hi>wood</hi> of the <hi>Kings</hi> Oak had been thrown down in their <hi>chambers;</hi> but of that, in the morning they found nothing had been moved.</p>
               <p n="40">40. <hi>October</hi> 21. The <hi>keeper</hi> of their <hi>Ordnary</hi> and his <hi>bitch,</hi> lay in one of the <hi>rooms</hi> with them, which night they were not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed at all. But <hi>October</hi> 22. though the <hi>bitch</hi> kennel'd there again (to whom they aſcribed their former nights reſt) both they and the <hi>bitch</hi> were in a pitiful taking; the <hi>bitch</hi> opening but once, and that with a <hi>whining, fearful</hi> yelp. <hi>October</hi> 23. they had all their cloaths pluckt off them in the <hi>with-drawing room,</hi> and the <hi>bricks</hi> fell out of the chimney into the <hi>room;</hi> and the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> they thought in the <hi>dining-room</hi> that all the <hi>wood</hi> of the <hi>Kings</hi> Oak had been brought thither, and thrown down cloſe by their <hi>bed</hi>-ſide, which noiſe being heard by thoſe of the <hi>with-drawing room,</hi> one of them roſe to ſee what was done, fearing indeed that his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> had been killed, but found no ſuch matter;
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:172327:127"/>
whereupon returning to his <hi>bed</hi> again, he found two dozen of <hi>trenchers</hi> thrown into it, and handſomly covered with the bed-cloaths.</p>
               <p n="41">41. <hi>October</hi> 25. The <hi>curtains</hi> of the <hi>bed</hi> in the <hi>with-drawing room</hi> were drawn to and fro, and the <hi>bedsted</hi> ſhaken as before: and in the <hi>bed-chamber</hi> glaſs flew about ſo thick (and yet not a pane of the <hi>chamber</hi> windows broken) that they thought it had rained <hi>money;</hi> whereupon they lighted candles, but to their grief they found nothing but <hi>glaſs,</hi> which they took up in the morning and laid together. <hi>October</hi> 29. Somthing walked in the <hi>with-drawing room</hi> about an hour, and going to the <hi>window</hi> opened and ſhut it; then going into the <hi>bed-chamber,</hi> it threw <hi>great ſtones</hi> for about half an hours time, ſome whereof lighted on the <hi>high-bed,</hi> and others on the <hi>truckle-bed,</hi> to the number in all of about four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore. This <hi>night</hi> there was alſo a very great noiſe, as though forty <hi>pieces</hi> of <hi>Ordnance</hi> had been ſhot off together; at two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>knocks</hi> it aſtoniſhed all the <hi>neighboring dwellers,</hi> which 'tis thought might have been heard a great way off. During theſe <hi>noiſes</hi> which were heard in both <hi>rooms</hi> together, both <hi>Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> and <hi>ſervants</hi> were ſtruck with ſo great horror, that they cryed out to one another for help, whereof <hi>one</hi> of them recovering <hi>himſelf</hi> out of a ſtrange <hi>agony</hi> he had been in, ſnatch'd up a <hi>ſword,</hi> and had like to have killed one of his <hi>Brethren</hi> coming out of his bed in his ſhirt, whom he took for the <hi>Spirit</hi> that did the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief: However, at length they got all together, yet the noiſe continued ſo great and terrible, and ſhook the <hi>walls</hi> ſo much, that they thought the whole <hi>Manor</hi> would have fell on their heads. At its departure it took all the <hi>glaſs</hi> away with it.</p>
               <p n="42">42. <hi>November</hi> 1. Somthing as they thought walk'd up and down the <hi>with-drawing room,</hi> and then made a noiſe in the <hi>dining-room:</hi> The <hi>ſtones</hi> that were left before and laid up in the <hi>with-draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-room,</hi> were all fetch'd away this night, and a great deal of <hi>glaſs</hi> (not like the former) thrown about again. <hi>November</hi> 2. came ſomthing into the <hi>with-drawing room</hi> treading (as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived) much like a <hi>Bear,</hi> which firſt only walking about a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour, at length it made a noiſe about the <hi>Table,</hi> and threw the <hi>warming-pan</hi> ſo violently, that it quite ſpoiled it: It threw alſo <hi>glaſs</hi> and <hi>great ſtones</hi> at them again, and the <hi>bones</hi> of <hi>horſes,</hi> and all ſo violently, that the <hi>bedſted</hi> and <hi>walls</hi> were bruiſed
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:172327:127"/>
by them. This night they ſet <hi>candles</hi> all about the <hi>rooms,</hi> and made <hi>fires</hi> up to the mantle-trees of the <hi>chimneys;</hi> but all were put out no body knew how, the <hi>fire,</hi> and <hi>billets</hi> that made it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thrown up and down the <hi>rooms;</hi> the <hi>curtains</hi> torn with the <hi>rods</hi> from their <hi>beds,</hi> and the <hi>bed-poſts</hi> pull'd away, that the <hi>teſter</hi> fell down upon them, and the feet of the <hi>bedsted</hi> cloven in two: And upon the <hi>ſervants</hi> in the <hi>truckle-bed,</hi> who lay all this time ſweating for fear, there was firſt a little, which made them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſtir; but before they could get out, there came a whole <hi>coule,</hi> as it were, of ſtinking <hi>ditch-water</hi> down upon them, ſo <hi>green,</hi> that it made their <hi>ſhirts</hi> and <hi>ſheets</hi> of that colour too.</p>
               <p n="43">43. The ſame night the <hi>windows</hi> were all broke by throwing of <hi>ſtones,</hi> and there was moſt terrible noiſes in three ſeveral places together, to the extraordinary wonder of all that lodged near them; nay, the very <hi>Cony-ſtealers</hi> that were abroad that night, were ſo affrighted with the diſmal thundering, that for haſt they left their <hi>Ferret</hi> in the <hi>Cony-boroughs</hi> behind them, beyond <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamonds well.</hi> Notwithſtanding all this, one of them had the boldneſs to ask in the Name of <hi>God, what it was? what it would have?</hi> and <hi>what they had done, that they ſhould be diſturbed in this manner?</hi> to which no <hi>anſwer</hi> was given, but the <hi>noiſe</hi> ceaſed for awhile. At length it came again, and (as all of them ſaid) brought ſeven <hi>Devils</hi> worſe than it ſelf. Whereupon one of them light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>candle</hi> again, and ſet it between the two <hi>chambers</hi> in the door-way, on which another of them fixing his <hi>eyes,</hi> ſaw the ſimilitude of a <hi>hoof</hi> ſtriking the <hi>candle</hi> and <hi>candle-ſtick</hi> into the middle of the <hi>bed-chamber,</hi> and afterwards making three ſcrapes on the ſnuff to put it out. Upon this the ſame perſon was ſo bold as to draw his <hi>ſword,</hi> but he had ſcarce got it out, but there was another <hi>inviſible hand</hi> had hold of it too, and tug'd with <hi>him</hi> for it, and prevailing, ſtruck <hi>him</hi> ſo violently with the <hi>pummel,</hi> that <hi>he</hi> was ſtun'd with the blow.</p>
               <p n="44">44. Then began grievous noiſes again, in ſo much that they called to one another, got together and went into the <hi>Preſence-chamber,</hi> where they ſaid <hi>Prayers</hi> and ſang <hi>Pſalms;</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all which, the thundring noiſe ſtill continued in other <hi>rooms.</hi> After this, <hi>November</hi> 3. they removed their <hi>Lodgings</hi> over the gate; and next day being <hi>Sunday,</hi> went to <hi>Ewelm,</hi> where how they eſcaped, the <hi>Authors</hi> of the <hi>Relations</hi> knew not;
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:172327:128"/>
but returning on <hi>Monday,</hi> the <hi>Devil</hi> (for that was the name they gave their nightly gueſt) left them not unviſited; nor on the <hi>Tueſday</hi> following, which was the laſt day they ſtaid. Where ends the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> (for ſo he was ſtiled by the people) of the juſt <hi>devil</hi> of <hi>Woodſtock;</hi> the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> and all their <hi>dependants</hi> going quite away on <hi>Wedneſday;</hi> ſince which time, ſays the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> that lived on the place, there have honeſt <hi>perſons</hi> of good <hi>Quality</hi> lodged in the <hi>Bed-chamber</hi> and <hi>with-drawing room,</hi> that never were diſturb'd in the leaſt like the <hi>Commiſſioners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="45">45. Moſt part of theſe <hi>Tranſactions,</hi> during the ſtay of theſe <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> 'tis true, might be eaſily performed by <hi>combination,</hi> but ſome there are of them ſcarce reconcilable to <hi>Jugling:</hi> Such as 1. The extraordinary <hi>noiſes,</hi> beyond the power of <hi>man</hi> to make, without ſuch <hi>inſtruments</hi> as were not there. 2. The taring down and ſpliting the <hi>bed-poſts,</hi> and puting out ſo many <hi>candles</hi> and ſo great <hi>fires</hi> no body knew how. 3. A viſible <hi>ſhape</hi> ſeen of a <hi>horſes</hi> hoof treading out the <hi>candle.</hi> And 4. a tugging with <hi>one</hi> of them for his <hi>ſword</hi> by an <hi>inviſible hand.</hi> All which being put together, perhaps may eaſily perſwade ſome <hi>man</hi> otherwiſe inclined, to believe, that <hi>immaterial beings</hi> might be concern'd in this buſineſs; which if it do, it abundantly will ſatisfie for the trouble of the <hi>Relation,</hi> ſtill provided the <hi>ſpeculative Theiſt,</hi> be not after all, a <hi>practical Atheiſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="46">46. And thus, before I am aware, being fallen amongſt the <hi>unuſual accidents</hi> that have happened to <hi>men only,</hi> the next unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable thing that preſents it ſelf, is a remarkable <hi>Dream</hi> of <hi>Thomas Wotton</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of <hi>Bocton Malherb</hi> in the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the famous Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> Provoſt of <hi>Eaton,</hi> whoſe <hi>dreams</hi> did uſually prove true, both in fore-telling things to come, and diſcovering things paſt. The <hi>dream,</hi> 'tis true, of which I am now writing, was had at <hi>Bocton</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> but the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant concern of it relating to <hi>Oxford,</hi> I thought fit rather of the <hi>two</hi> to place it here; the particulars whereof, as taken <hi>verbatim</hi> out of Sir <hi>Henry Wottons</hi> life<note n="b" place="bottom">Inter Reliquias Wottonianas.</note>, are briefly theſe.</p>
               <p n="47">47, <hi>This</hi> Thomas Wotton, <hi>a little before his death</hi> dreamed, <hi>that the</hi> Univerſity Treaſury <hi>was robbed by</hi> Towns-men <hi>and</hi> poor Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, <hi>and that the number was five. And being that day to write to his Son</hi> Henry (<hi>then a Scholar of</hi> Queens College) <hi>at</hi> Oxford,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:172327:128"/>
                  <hi>he thought it worth ſo much pains, as by a Poſtſcript in his Letter, to make a ſlight enquiry of it. The Letter (which was writ out of</hi> Kent, <hi>and dated three days before) came to his</hi> Sons <hi>hands the very morning after the night in which the robbery was committed; and when the</hi> Univerſity <hi>and</hi> City <hi>were both in a perplext inqueſt of the Thieves, then did Mr.</hi> Wotton <hi>ſhew his Fathers Letter, by which ſuch light was given of this work of darkneſs, that the five guilty perſons were preſently diſcovered, and apprehended.</hi>

               <p n="48">48. Amongſt the <hi>unuſual accidents</hi> attending men in their <hi>Lives,</hi> we muſt alſo reckon all <hi>unuſual diſeaſes,</hi> ſuch as that of Mr. <hi>Evans</hi> Rector of <hi>Heath,</hi> who had a <hi>Ranula</hi> under his <hi>tongue,</hi> wherein there bred a <hi>stone,</hi> I ſuppoſe <hi>è ſanguine craſſo &amp; terreſtri;</hi> or as they call it, a <hi>Tartareous</hi> humor got together in the <hi>veins</hi> under the <hi>tongue,</hi> ſo hard and great that it almoſt quite deprived <hi>him</hi> of his ſpeech; which he drew away with his own hand, and as he told me ſent it to the <hi>Medicin School</hi> at <hi>Oxford;</hi> but upon ſearch I could not find it, nor had the <hi>School-keeper</hi> ever heard of any ſuch matter: So that whoever he were that he ſent it by, proved falſe both to <hi>him</hi> and the <hi>

               <p n="10">10. That which I intend here (ſays he) is the correction of the <hi>Calendar</hi> now in uſe in the <hi>Church. Julius Caeſar</hi> indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing learned in <hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> compleated the <hi>Calendar</hi> very well for his time, and as <hi>Hiſtories</hi> tell us, diſputed in <hi>Egypt</hi> againſt <hi>Acho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and his Maſter <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> concerning the quantity of the <hi>Solar</hi> year, on which our <hi>Calendar</hi> is founded, which made <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> bring him in ſpeaking to this effect, <q>

                  </q>
But <hi>Julius</hi> never came to the knowledge of the true quantity of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:172327:133"/>
the <hi>year,</hi> which he made to conſiſt of 365 days, and a whole <hi>fourth</hi> part of a day, which <hi>fourth</hi> part collected at four years end, made, that in the <hi>Biſſextil</hi> there was one day more than in any other <hi>year:</hi> But 'tis manifeſt (ſays he) to all <hi>Aſtronomers</hi> both old and new, and 'tis plain from the rules of <hi>Astronomy,</hi> that the quantity of the <hi>Solar</hi> year is not ſo much, but leſs, and that as 'tis judged by wiſe men, by the 130<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of a day; whence it comes to paſs, that in 130 years we have one ſuperfluous day, which were it but taken away, the <hi>Calendar</hi> would be corrected as to this error.</p>
               <p n="11">11.

The <hi>foot plough</hi> does beſt at the <hi>henting, i.e.</hi> ending of a Land, it going cloſe up to a <hi>hedge,</hi> and not being ſubject to over-throw; whereas the <hi>wheel plough,</hi> if care and diſcretion do not meet in the <hi>holder,</hi> is apt to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw there, the Land being ridged; but goes much more light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and eaſie for the <hi>Horſes</hi> than the <hi>foot plough</hi> doth, which is the ſum of the Conveniencies and Inconveniencies of both.</p>
               <p n="77">77. After <hi>Ploughing</hi> and <hi>Sowing,</hi> they cover their <hi>Corn</hi> with <hi>Harrows,</hi> whereof ſome have 4, 5, or 6 <hi>bulls,</hi> or <hi>ſpars</hi> apiece, each of them armed with five <hi>tines,</hi> and of a ſquare form as at moſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>places.</hi> But at <hi>Whitfield,</hi> near Sir <hi>Thomas Tippings,</hi> I ſaw a great weighty <hi>triangular Harrow,</hi> whoſe <hi>tines</hi> ſtood not in rows after the manner of <hi>others,</hi> its uſe being in ground much ſubject to <hi>Quitch-graſs,</hi> whoſe roots it ſeems continually paſſing between the <hi>tines</hi> of other <hi>Harrows,</hi> are not ſo eaſily dragged forth by them, as this, whoſe <hi>tines</hi> ſtand not in <hi>rows,</hi> and is drawn with one of the <hi>Angles</hi> fore-moſt, after the manner of a <hi>Wedge:</hi> Yet I could not find it anſwer'd expectation ſo well as to obtain in other places, moſt thinking the <hi>great ſquare Bull harrow,</hi> drawn by the ſecond
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:172327:150"/>
                  <hi>bull</hi> on the <hi>near ſide</hi> of the <hi>harrow,</hi> to take the Graſs much better than that.</p>
               <p n="78">78. But the worſt ground to <hi>harrow</hi> of all others is new <hi>broken Land,</hi> the parts of its furrows being commonly ſo faſt knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the roots of the graſs, that though great charge and trouble be afforded in the <hi>harrowing,</hi> yet after all it will not ſo <hi>disperſe</hi> the <hi>Corn,</hi> but that it will come up as it fell, thick and in ranks between the <hi>furrows,</hi> and ſcarce any where elſe. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent theſe inconveniencies, the Ingenious Mr. <hi>Sacheverel,</hi> late of <hi>Bolſcot,</hi> deceaſed, contrived a way of <hi>howing</hi> the <hi>earth</hi> from the <hi>turf</hi> as ſoon as a little dryed, thereby firſt laying his ground even and then ſowing it; by which means his <hi>ſeed</hi> not only fell and came up equally diſperſt in all parts alike, but he found that a quantity conſiderably leſs, did this way ſerve the turn. Which <hi>Experiment</hi> he often made with good approbation, the charge of <hi>howing</hi> not exceeding that of <hi>harrowing,</hi> which without it muſt be great, whereas after it, one <hi>croſs tine</hi> covers the <hi>Corn</hi> well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
               <p n="79">79. After <hi>harrowing,</hi> if it hath been ſo dry a time, that the ground has riſen in <hi>clods</hi> that cannot be broken with <hi>harrows,</hi> they commonly do it with a <hi>beetle,</hi> or <hi>big ſtick:</hi> But a much quicker way is that I met with about <hi>Biſſeter</hi> by a weighty <hi>Roll,</hi> not cut round, but <hi>octangular,</hi> the edges whereof meeting with the <hi>clods,</hi> would break them effectually, and with great expedition. I was ſhewed alſo at <hi>Bolſcot</hi> another uncommon <hi>Roll,</hi> invented by the ſame Mr. <hi>Sacheverel</hi> above-mentioned, cut neither <hi>ſmooth</hi> nor to <hi>angles,</hi> but notched deep and pretty broad, after the manner of a <hi>Teſſella</hi> or <hi>Lattice,</hi> ſo that the protuberant parts remained al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as big as the foot of a <hi>Horſe,</hi> by which being large and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he could ſo firmly preſs his <hi>light Land</hi> ſubject to <hi>Quich-graſs</hi> and other <hi>weeds,</hi> and ſo ſettle the roots of the <hi>Corn,</hi> that it would come up even and well; whereas if it had been left hollow it would certainly have been choaked, and came to little; He aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it alſo excelled a ſmooth <hi>Roll,</hi> eſpecially if the Seaſon proved dry and windy, in that, when a Field is <hi>rolled</hi> ſmooth, the <hi>wind</hi> is apt to blow the <hi>Earth</hi> from the <hi>Corn,</hi> whereas by this the ground is laid ſo uneven and full of holes, like <hi>Chequer-work,</hi> that what the wind blows from the <hi>ridges,</hi> ſtill falls into the <hi>hollows</hi> between them, and on the contrary gives the <hi>Corn</hi> the better root.</p>
               <p n="80">
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:172327:150"/>80. I have heard of another ſort of <hi>Roll,</hi> of a large <hi>diameter,</hi> and weighty, ſet the whole length with edged plates of <hi>steel,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent from the body of the <hi>Roll</hi> about an inch and half; thus contrived for the quicker cutting of <hi>turf,</hi> which drawn firſt one way, and croſs again at <hi>right angles,</hi> cuts the <hi>turf</hi> into ſquares, in bigneſs proportionable to the diſtance of the edged <hi>plates</hi> on the <hi>Roll,</hi> requiring no farther trouble afterward, then to be pared off the ground with a <hi>turfing Spade,</hi> which ſeems to promiſe well for the cutting out of <hi>Trenches, Drains. &amp;c.</hi> But this I have not ſeen, nor has it that I know of, been yet experimented by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious <hi>Inventor:</hi> However, I thought fit to offer it to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of <hi>Improvers,</hi> and the rather becauſe it affords me a ſmooth tranſition from the conſideration of the <hi>Arable,</hi> to the <hi>Meddow</hi> and <hi>Paſture Lands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="81">81. For the <hi>Meddow grounds</hi> of this <hi>County,</hi> as they are numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſo they are <hi>fertile</hi> beyond all <hi>preference,</hi> for they need no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>compost</hi> to be laid on them, than what the <hi>Floods</hi> ſpontaneouſly give them, and therefore the <hi>Reader</hi> muſt not expect any methods or rules concerning that affair here: Nor concerning the <hi>remedies</hi> of annoyances, ſuch as <hi>Sour-graſs, Moſſes, Ruſhes, Sedges, &amp;c.</hi> for I find none of our <hi>meddows</hi> much troubled with them. As for their <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p-lands,</hi> when they prepare them for <hi>graſs,</hi> they make them as rich as they can with their moſt ſuitable <hi>ſoils,</hi> and lay them alſo dry to keep them from <hi>Ruſhes</hi> and <hi>Sedges;</hi> if any thing <hi>boggy,</hi> they uſually <hi>trench</hi> them; but that proves not ſufficient, for the <hi>trenches</hi> of <hi>boggy grounds</hi> will ſwell, and fill up of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p n="82">82. To prevent which inconveniency, I know an ingenious <hi>Husbandman,</hi> that having dug his <hi>trenches</hi> about a yard deep and two foot over, firſt laid at the bottom green <hi>Black-thorn</hi> buſhes, and on them a <hi>ſtratum</hi> of large round ſtones, or at leaſt ſuch as would not lie cloſe; and over them again, another <hi>ſtratum</hi> of <hi>Black-thorn,</hi> and upon them <hi>ſtraw,</hi> to keep the dirt from falling in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween, and filling them up: by which means he kept his <hi>trench</hi> open, and procured ſo conſtant and durable a <hi>drain,</hi> that the <hi>land</hi> is ſince ſunk a foot or 18 inches, and become firm enough to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port <hi>carriages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="83">83. As for the <hi>Graſſes</hi> ſown in this <hi>County,</hi> I have little more to add concerning them, but what was ſaid before in the Chapter
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:172327:151"/>
of <hi>Plants,</hi> only that it has been found moſt agreeable that <hi>Sanct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foin, Ray-graſs, &amp;c.</hi> be not ſown preſently after the <hi>Barly, Oats,</hi> or whatever other <hi>Grain</hi> it be ſowed with, but rather after the <hi>Corn</hi> is come pretty high, ſo that it may ſhelter the <hi>ſeed</hi> from the heat of the <hi>Sun,</hi> which, as is apprehended at leaſt, is ſomtimes prejudicial. And that in the <hi>Chiltern Country,</hi> after they have eaten off their <hi>Ray-graſs</hi> or <hi>Sanct-foin,</hi> they find it advantagious to <hi>fold</hi> it with <hi>Sheep,</hi> as other <hi>Corn-lands:</hi> which I thought good to note, it being, as I am informed, but lately practiſed.</p>
               <p n="84">84. Amongſt <hi>Arts</hi> that concern <hi>formation</hi> of <hi>Earths,</hi> I ſhall not mention the making of <hi>Pots</hi> at <hi>Marſh-Balden,</hi> and <hi>Nuneham-Courtney;</hi> nor of <hi>Tobacco-pipes</hi> of the <hi>White-earth</hi> of <hi>Shot-over,</hi> ſince thoſe places are now deſerted.

               <p n="87">87.

After the <hi>Herbaceous Plants,</hi> come we next to conſider the <hi>Shrubs</hi> and <hi>Subfrutices,</hi> amongſt which I met with one, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I may ſay ſcarce heard of <hi>curioſity,</hi> though it have been an <hi>Experiment</hi> frequently performed many years ſince, not only by thoſe excellent <hi>Gardeners</hi> and <hi>Botaniſts,</hi> the two <hi>Bobarts,</hi> Father and Son; but as I have heard alſo by the Reverend and Ingenious <hi>Robert Sharrock</hi> L L D, and Fellow of <hi>New College,</hi> who after many unſucceſsful tryals of <hi>grafting</hi> one <hi>Fruit</hi> upon another, made at laſt a very pleaſant <hi>one,</hi> and to good <hi>advantage</hi> too, upon different <hi>Vines,</hi> which in ſo great meaſure anſwer'd their hopes, that they have now ſignal proof in the <hi>Phyſick Garden</hi> of the <hi>white Frontiniac</hi> grafted upon the <hi>Parſly Vine,</hi> growing and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very well; and to this <hi>advantage,</hi> that they think the early ripening ſtock of the <hi>Parſly Vine,</hi> to conduce ſomwhat to the

earlyer ripening of the <hi>white Frontiniac,</hi> naturally late.</p>
               <p n="114">114. They have alſo <hi>grafted</hi> the <hi>early red-cluſter</hi> or <hi>Currant-grape,</hi> upon that large, luxuriantly growing <hi>Vine,</hi> called the <hi>Fox-grape,</hi> which ſeems to produce much fairer and ſtronger <hi>Fruit,</hi> than that <hi>grape</hi> is uſually upon its own <hi>ſtock.</hi> And divers other <hi>Experiments</hi> of this <hi>nature</hi> they ſay may eaſily be made, as well to have <hi>white</hi> and <hi>black,</hi> or other <hi>varieties,</hi> as they have already <hi>broad leav'd</hi> and <hi>narrow leav'd, early grapes</hi> and <hi>late ones,</hi> on the ſame <hi>ſtock:</hi> But this is not to be done by preſent <hi>amputation,</hi> as in other <hi>Fruits,</hi> the wood being not ſufficiently ſolid to bear it.</p>
               <p n="115">115. As to the <hi>Arts</hi> relating to <hi>Trees,</hi> the chiefeſt are thoſe of the <hi>Planter</hi> and <hi>Gardener</hi> making curious <hi>Walks,</hi> and <hi>Topiary works</hi> of them; ſuch is the <hi>Dial</hi> cut in <hi>Box</hi> in <hi>New College</hi> Garden, the <hi>Kings arms,</hi> and the <hi>College</hi> coat of <hi>arms</hi> there, and at <hi>Exeter College;</hi> beſide the other Garden <hi>knots</hi> of <hi>Box</hi> in both thoſe <hi>Colleges,</hi> and in <hi>Braſen-noſe College</hi> Quadrangle; to which add the <hi>Guards</hi> at the <hi>Phyſick garden</hi> gate of <hi>Gigantick</hi> ſtature, and ſeveral other <hi>Topia</hi> in the ſame <hi>Garden,</hi> all formed of the <hi>Yew tree.</hi> Of <hi>Walks,</hi> the moſt curious I have met with in this County, are thoſe elegant ones of <hi>Trees</hi> of various kinds in <hi>Cornbury Park;</hi> and (to omit the numerous Walks in and about the <hi>

               <p n="116">116. For <hi>Garden walks,</hi> I think one of the longeſt I met with, was at the Worſhipful Mr. <hi>Clerks</hi> at <hi>Aston Rowant.</hi> And for a deſcent, there are none like the Walks at <hi>Rouſham,</hi> in the Garden of the Worſhipful <hi>Robert Dormer</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> where there are no leſs than <hi>five</hi> one under another, leading from the <hi>garden</hi> above, down to the <hi>river</hi> ſide, having <hi>ſteps</hi> at each end, and parted with <hi>hedges</hi> of <hi>Codlings, &amp;c.</hi> But of all that I ever met with, there is a Walk at the Worſhipful Mr. <hi>Fermors</hi> of <hi>Tuſmore,</hi> the moſt wonderfully pleaſant, not only in that it is placed in the middle of a <hi>Fiſh-pond,</hi> but ſo contrived, that ſtanding in the middle no Eye can perceive but it is perfectly <hi>ſtreight,</hi> whereas when removed to either end, it appears on the contrary ſo ſtrangely crooked, that the Eye does not reach much above half the way,</p>

                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:172327:158"/>117. Which deception of ſight moſt certainly ariſes from a <hi>bow</hi> in the middle, which ſeems only an <hi>ornament,</hi> and the <hi>inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity</hi> of the <hi>Beholder</hi> of ſeeing both parts of the <hi>Walk</hi> at one time; which that it may be the better apprehended, ſee the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it, Tab. 13.

               <p n="118">118. Hither alſo belong the <hi>methods</hi> whereby they order their <hi>Woods</hi> in this <hi>County,</hi> which if <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder-woods</hi> in or near the <hi>Forreſt</hi> of <hi>Whichwood,</hi> they commonly fell not till <hi>twenty years</hi> growth; but in the <hi>Chaſe</hi> near by it, ſomtimes at ſeven or eight: dividing them into <hi>Acres</hi> and <hi>Braids</hi> (or bredths) every <hi>Acre</hi> containing forty <hi>braids,</hi> a <hi>braid</hi> being one <hi>pole</hi> long and four broad; into which they thus divide their <hi>Woods</hi> for the better ſale of them to the meaner ſort of people, ſome buying ten, others twenty, and ſome thirty <hi>braids</hi> or more.</p>
               <p n="119">119. In the <hi>Chiltern Country</hi> they fell their Under-wood <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices</hi> commonly at eight or nine <hi>years</hi> growth, but their <hi>tall wood,</hi> or <hi>Copices</hi> of which they make <hi>tall ſhids, billet, &amp;c.</hi> at no certain time; nor fell they theſe <hi>Woods</hi> all together, but draw them as they call it, almoſt every <hi>year</hi> ſome, according as their <hi>wood</hi> comes to be of a fit ſcantling for <hi>tall ſhid</hi> or <hi>billet,</hi> cutting every <hi>ſhid</hi> of <hi>tall wood</hi> four foot long beſide the <hi>kerf,</hi> and the <hi>billet</hi> three foot four inches, according to the <hi>Statutes</hi> of the 7 of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. 7. and the 43 of <hi>Q.

               <p n="120">120.

each of them in a ſmall <hi>trough,</hi> no bigger than juſt to admit the <hi>noſe</hi> of a <hi>Hog,</hi> and come all of them with their <hi>ends</hi> ſo near the <hi>bottom,</hi> that there is never above a handful of <hi>beans</hi> or ſo, in each <hi>trough</hi> at a time, which taken away by the <hi>Hogs,</hi> there follow ſo many handfulls again, but never more: ſo that having alſo drawn a ſmall <hi>Rivulet</hi> of water through the <hi>ſty,</hi> the daily trouble of <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> waiting on them is not only ſaved (for they need never come near <hi>them</hi> till they know they are <hi>fat</hi>) but the <hi>Hogs</hi> themſelves are alſo made hereby uncapable of ſpoiling a <hi>bean,</hi> by trampling or piſſing amongſt them as in moſt other <hi>ſties,</hi> they never having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a handful at a time, and thoſe in a <hi>trough</hi> too ſmall to admit any ſuch means of <hi>waſt.</hi>

He has thoughts alſo of applying the ſame <hi>contrivance</hi> to the feeding of his <hi>Hounds;</hi> and has made <hi>ſtalls</hi> for <hi>Oxen,</hi> by <hi>ſpars</hi> of wood deſcending perpendicularly from the utmoſt <hi>rim</hi> of the <hi>rack,</hi> and nailing boards on them half way up before the <hi>Oxen,</hi> that they cannot ſpoil by trampling, or any other means, the leaſt <hi>ſtraw</hi> or <hi>graſs,</hi> all that go beſide their mouths falling ſtill within the boards nailed upon the <hi>ſpars,</hi> which when come to any quantity, is returned into the <hi>rack</hi> as ſweet and good, as when put there at firſt.

               <p n="124">124. Of <hi>Arts</hi> that reſpect <hi>Mankind,</hi> and firſt of <hi>Architecture,</hi> wherein we have many remarkable <hi>Curioſities,</hi> as well in the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> as <hi>

Of the firſt ſort are ſeveral <hi>Mills</hi> that I have met with in this <hi>County,</hi> ſcarce perhaps to be found elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in <hi>England;</hi> ſuch is that at the ſame ingenious Mr. <hi>Fermors</hi> at <hi>Tuſmore,</hi> which with one <hi>horſe</hi> and <hi>man</hi> (who is carryed round as it were, in a <hi>Coach-box</hi> behind the <hi>horſe</hi>) performs at pleaſure theſe very many <hi>offices.</hi> Firſt, it grinds <hi>Apples</hi> the common way for <hi>Cider.</hi> And ſecondly <hi>Wheat,</hi> which it <hi>ſifts</hi> at the ſame time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to four different fineneſſes.

               <p n="125">125. At <hi>Hanwell,</hi> in the Park, there is alſo a <hi>Mill</hi> erected by the ingenious Sir <hi>Anthony Cope,</hi> of wonderful contrivance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with that great <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> did not only grind the <hi>Corn</hi> for his Houſe,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:172327:159"/>
but with the ſame motion turned a very large <hi>Engine</hi> for cutting the hardeſt ſtone, after the manner of <hi>Lapidaries;</hi> and another for boaring of <hi>Guns:</hi> and theſe, as in the <hi>Mill</hi> at <hi>Tuſmore,</hi> either ſeverally or all together, at pleaſure.</p>

had purſued the deſign of a <hi>dumb Character</hi> a conſiderable time, at laſt he perceived that it would naturally reſolve it ſelf into a <hi>Language,</hi> having this advantage over any <hi>Character,</hi> that we may uſe our known <hi>Alphabet</hi> to expreſs it, whereas in a <hi>Character</hi> the <hi>figures</hi> muſt be new.

And ſecondly, that had this place been at firſt deſigned for the Inauguration of a <hi>Daniſh</hi> or <hi>Norwegian</hi> King, and ſuch places been ſo eſſential to a good <hi>title,</hi> as pretended above, §. 93. certainly all the Kings of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> race that reigned after here in <hi>England,</hi> would have been either crowned here, or at ſome other ſuch <hi>Forum;</hi> whereas we have no ſuch <hi>Kongſtolen</hi> in the middle of the <hi>Cirque;</hi> and beſide, find <hi>Canutus</hi> with great ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnity Crowned at <hi>London, Harold Harefoot</hi> here at <hi>Oxford</hi> (not far from this <hi>Cirque</hi>) and <hi>Hardi-Canute</hi> likewiſe at <hi>London.</hi>

               <p n="99">99. To which it may be replyed, that though not placed in the <hi>Cirque,</hi> yet here is a <hi>Kongſtolen</hi> not far off, which 'tis like was not neceſſary ſhould be ſet within it; for I find the <hi>place</hi> where the new <hi>elected</hi> King ſtood and ſhewed <hi>himſelf</hi> to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, at the <hi>Forum</hi> for this purpoſe at <hi>Leire</hi> in <hi>Seland,</hi> to have been without the <hi>Area,</hi> as our <hi>Kongſtolen</hi> is. <hi>Area ſaxis undique cincta Coronationi Regum deputata vicinum habet Collem, cui Coronatus jam inſiſtebat jura populo daturus, &amp; omnibus conſpiciendum ſe praebiturus</hi>
